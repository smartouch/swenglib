    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reality of most testing efforts is that there is a little of both manual and automated testing involved. Rarely is&#xD;
    testing ever completely manual or completely automated. The truth is that each approach has its own advantages and&#xD;
    disadvantages. However, manual testing often gets short shrift. It is often described as being error-prone, incapable&#xD;
    of dealing with repetitive testing tasks efficiently, incapable of providing reuse of testing content, not exhaustive,&#xD;
    and hard to organize.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This criticism arises in large part from equating manual testing with &quot;testing by hand&quot; or, at best, &quot;testing with&#xD;
    Excel&amp;reg;&quot;. Recent advances in manual testing tooling, though, have dramatically changed the testing landscape. Such&#xD;
    advances allow the tester to employ testing techniques that have until recently only been the concern of the automated&#xD;
    testing world. This guideline addresses some of the more prevalent techniques used in the manual testing tooling world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Tool-Assisted Manual Testing&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the main problems with manual testing is that it is difficult to enforce a standard approach to testing. Without&#xD;
    any way of enforcing how you design, run, and analyze tests, the manual testing effort can easily degenerate into a&#xD;
    myriad of loosely related files and file types, test data, and ad-hoc reporting formats. A manual testing tool enforces&#xD;
    a consistent approach to testing by allowing for script editing, test content reuse, and a consistent test execution&#xD;
    mechanism, all from one testing environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When designing manual tests, what you need in many cases is the ability to group tests, and have these groupings easily&#xD;
    updated and managed. Manual testing tools can enforce a grouping mechanism on your tests. Ideally, a manual testing&#xD;
    tool also lets you easily categorize parts of your test into groups. If at some point certain parts of your test no&#xD;
    longer need to be grouped, you can easily ungroup test steps as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another major area of concern for manual testing involves executing test scripts. Running a manual test can require a&#xD;
    lot of testing resources just to control and track test scripts. This can easily lead to errors introduced in the&#xD;
    testing effort. Usually these errors are difficult to identify, and they can require additional resources to track&#xD;
    down. With a manual testing tool, the script execution is controlled by the tracking mechanism of the tool. Although&#xD;
    the script itself is not run in an automated sense, the way the tester progresses from step to step can be tracked and&#xD;
    controlled by the tool.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With tool-assisted manual testing, you can also avail yourself of one of the most powerful aspects of automated&#xD;
    testing, namely, reusing test content. A manual testing tool provides a way to reuse test content, preferably in the&#xD;
    form of test script content that naturally serves as steps that can be applied to other test scripts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Much of your time as a tester is spent reviewing test results. In a purely manual testing environment, this can be&#xD;
    difficult and time-consuming. Manually maintaining test scripts and test logs can be a daunting task. A manual testing&#xD;
    tool can provide a test execution log that usually is accessible through the testing tool itself. The manual testing&#xD;
    tool allows you to organize the test logs and analyze them from within one testing environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Summary&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A manual testing approach, supported by the appropriate tool, can include many of the same concepts used in an&#xD;
    automated testing approach. Clearly, there are differences. Moreover, there are cases that are naturally more suited to&#xD;
    an automated approach, just as there are ones more suited to a manual testing approach. However, simply because a test&#xD;
    is manual does not mean that it cannot be designed, run, and analyzed methodically. Automated testing techniques --&#xD;
    such as script reuse, grouping mechanisms, and enforcement of a common test run and analysis approach -- need not apply&#xD;
    only to the world of automated testing.&lt;br />&#xD;
