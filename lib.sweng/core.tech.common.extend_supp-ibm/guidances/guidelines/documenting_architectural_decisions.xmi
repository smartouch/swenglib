    Before making any important decisions about the architecture, make sure that the process for making decisions has the&#xD;
    right level of sponsorship necessary to enforce those decisions. Get agreement from affected parties on the decision&#xD;
    making process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When documenting an architectural decision, be sure to capture the issue addressed, and the actual decision made to&#xD;
    resolve the issue. Include some discussion about the rationale behind the decision, the options considered, and the&#xD;
    justification for choosing one option over another.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review or consider one or more of the following when drawing up a list of alternatives:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project objectives, goals, critical success factors, business drivers, and so on, that may have been provided by&#xD;
        the stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The system requirements (business processes, use cases, qualities, constraints, and change cases)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architectural principles, policies, and guidelines drawn up by the stakeholder&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Relevant reference architectures, architectural patterns, or assets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product literature available from vendors or their Web sites&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical information published in books, journals, Web sites, and so on&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project documentation such as plans, key milestones and dates, and so on&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the following questions as part of the decision making process:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Does the solution need to comply with a reference architecture or architectural pattern?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Does the architecture need to comply with any over-arching principles, policies, guidelines, or standards?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the systems management and support implications of the decision?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the security and privacy implications of the decision?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How does the decision affect the total cost of ownership?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the decision requires the use of vendor products, packages, consulting, or support, what are its implications?&#xD;
        For example, what is the experience of the vendor? Are there suitable service level agreements in place? Are there&#xD;
        any liability or legal issues to address?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the decision requires the use of a product or package, what is the lead time on procuring these? Is the time&#xD;
        consistent with project timelines?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any changes you need to take into account?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At a minimum, document decisions that affect the overall structure of the system, the partitioning and distribution of&#xD;
    functionality, or the selection of a particular product, package, or asset. You should still document additional&#xD;
    architectural decisions, but do so less formally (either as part of the overall architectural model, or by using only a&#xD;
    subset of the information outlined here).&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that the overall set of architectural decisions covers the full scope of the project. Decisions that focus on&#xD;
    only a few areas may mean that insufficient architectural influence is exerted. The full set of decisions includes&#xD;
    those items that require global coordination across the program. They should address the classic trade-off questions,&#xD;
    such as those relating to performance, flexibility, extensibility, availability, and reliability.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make architecturally significant decisions early; this is the key to a good architecture in that it sets the foundation&#xD;
    on which the rest of the architecture is based. Test or prototype architectural decisions early. If necessary,&#xD;
    reconsider them based on information gathered from these activities. You do not need to make all decisions at once: you&#xD;
    can spread them out as the system evolves. For example, you might ignore the details of persistence early in the&#xD;
    project provided that you have identified a component or mechanism that deals with persistence. Address high-risk&#xD;
    architectural decisions first. High-risk areas are those for which there is little knowledge available, or that may&#xD;
    involve untried technology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Inform all affected parties about the decisions. Carry through and actually implement decisions, and track them to show&#xD;
    evidence the decisions are enforced.&#xD;
