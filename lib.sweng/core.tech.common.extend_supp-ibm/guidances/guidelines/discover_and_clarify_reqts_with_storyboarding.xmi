  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The fundamental purpose of storyboarding is to take someone's vision of carrying out an activity and communicating that&#xD;
    vision to developers who can create that vision.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Storyboarding is a technique, within requirements definition, that is used to both discover and to clarify&#xD;
    requirements. This technique can be used at many points within a development lifecycle and is equally relevant for&#xD;
    Systems development as it is for software development.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Storyboarding may take place as early as the Inception Phase to identify what capabilities (goals) the stakeholder may&#xD;
    wish obtain. At this phase in development the 'System' (whether it includes hardware or just software) does not exist.&#xD;
    Alternatively it could take place later in the development and would be used to clarify how something (user) may&#xD;
    interact with the item being developed (User Interface). Therefore, the purposes for storyboarding will be different at&#xD;
    various phases in the development.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Before storyboarding should take place it is essential that the problem to be solved is clearly identified. Once the&#xD;
    problem has been identified then the purpose of the storyboard can be defined. The purpose should clearly 'bound' the&#xD;
    area under investigation so providing the scope for the storyboarding. Within this 'bounding' any constraints that may&#xD;
    be applicable for the storyboard should be identified.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Following the completion of a storyboard, checks should be made to verify that the purpose of the storyboard has been&#xD;
    resolved. It is essential that the stakeholders involved in storyboarding take ownership of the developed storyboard,&#xD;
    in effect, 'signing up' to the storyboard validating that it correctly expresses their thoughts. To enable ownership it&#xD;
    is essential that the storyboard is developed using terms that they understand.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The end state of the item under investigation should be documented and any further potential related storyboards should&#xD;
    also be identified (maybe because of dependencies). A list of assumptions made during the storyboard should be gathered&#xD;
    (which can later be verified as being correct) plus any constraints discovered during the storyboarding.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Following the storyboard, requirements should be generated from the results of the storyboard with traceability (back&#xD;
    to the specific element within the storyboard) and agreed with the stakeholder. These requirements would then be placed&#xD;
    within the appropriate requirements set from which the need for the storyboard first emerged.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A typical template for creating a storyboard would include the pre and post conditions as detailed below:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Pre Conditions&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>1. Define the Problem&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    It is important to fully understand the problem to be addressed. If storyboarding is being employed during the&#xD;
    Inception Phase, it is likely that the problem being addressed is to identify what 'capabilities' the stakeholder will&#xD;
    obtain. This may be initiated from original stakeholder needs. If storyboarding is taking place later in the&#xD;
    development lifecycle, then it is more likely that the problem being addressed will involve identification of some&#xD;
    feature or behavior of something under development.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: The retail shopper statement of need - I wish to shop for items from retail outlets without&#xD;
    leaving my home.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: Implementation centric need - How can the music enthusiast confirm whether he will enjoy the&#xD;
    item he is purchasing?&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>2. Define the Purpose of Storyboarding&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    The storyboard to be developed should focus on the problem identified; however, the problem being resolved may need a&#xD;
    number of stakeholder viewpoints to be considered. Therefore, it may be that several storyboards have to be created to&#xD;
    fully address the problem under investigation. Stakeholders and analysts must understand the boundary of the&#xD;
    storyboard. This is best defined by clearly stating the purpose for the specific storyboard.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: To identify how a classical music enthusiast may wish to purchase music from retail outlets&#xD;
    while remaining at home&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: To identify the location, appearance and occurrence of the 'Sample play' function within the&#xD;
    on-line market GUI&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>3. Define Type of Storyboarding&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    There are fundamentally two types of storyboard. These are Requirements Discovery storyboards or Requirements&#xD;
    Clarification storyboards. These storyboards would cover all examples of where storyboarding may be needed,&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
    example,&amp;nbsp;Capability Discovery, Use-case Development, User Interfacing, Requirements Clarifying, Prototyping.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: Capability Requirements Discovery&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: Prototyping Requirements Clarification&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>4. Identify Development Lifecycle Phase&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Clearly there is a relationship between the type of storyboard to be used and the phase of the development lifecycle.&#xD;
    It is likely that during the Inception Phase that requirements are being 'discovered', while in the Elaboration Phase&#xD;
    there may need to be a further understanding and clarification of the requirements.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>5. Determine Level of Fidelity to be Used&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    When planning to use storyboarding, the level of fidelity (that is,&amp;nbsp;how accurately must the storyboard reflect the&#xD;
    theme under investigation) should be determined. It is likely that a low level of fidelity could be used when&#xD;
    storyboarding during the Inception Phase, as it is unlikely to be clear what the 'end' product will be. When using&#xD;
    storyboarding during the Elaboration Phase, it is likely that there will be considerable knowledge of what the end&#xD;
    product will be and will appear like. The higher level of fidelity will be important to accurate reflect this&#xD;
    appearance to enable the clarification of requirements to take place.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>6. Identify Stakeholder Role&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/em>The role of the stakeholder to be questioned during storyboarding should be identified, particularly when there&#xD;
    will be multiple storyboards.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: Retail shopper&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: Music enthusiast&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>7. Identify Constraints&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Before the storyboard begins, it is essential that any constraints applicable for the storyboard are identified. This&#xD;
    will ensure that the development remains within any limiting circumstances such as legal constraints or domain&#xD;
    standards.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: An audit trail of the order/purchase process must be available for scrutinizers&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: The GUI should conform to Standard Windows conventions&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Post Conditions&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Following the completion of the storyboard it is essential that the validity of the developed storyboard is confirmed&#xD;
    and any further follow-on work is identified.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>1. Confirm original problem resolved&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Has the storyboard fully resolved the original problem identified?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Yes/Partial/No&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>2. Confirm purpose of storyboard satisfied&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Was the purpose of conducting the storyboard satisfied?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Yes/No&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>3. Storyboard agreed with Stakeholder&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/em>Has the stakeholder involved with the storyboard taken ownership for the storyboard yet?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Yes/Under review/No&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>4. Further storyboard themes identified&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    During the development of the storyboard were other storyboard themes identified. What were those themes and what&#xD;
    stakeholder roles would be involved?&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Inception Phase Example: How the retailers may keep track of deliveries&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elaboration Phase Example: The location, appearance, and occurrence of the album art feature&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>5. Related storyboards&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying where other storyboards have been or are planned to be developed. Typical where a sequence of actions, each&#xD;
    fully discovered via separate storyboards.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>6. Assumptions made&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying any assumptions that were made during the storyboard development. These assumptions will require follow-up&#xD;
    action to confirm if correct&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Example: only valid with UK legal jurisdiction&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>7. New Constraints&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying any constraints discovered during the storyboard development and not already defined in the&#xD;
    pre-conditions&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>8. Requirements sources identified within the storyboard&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/em>&#xD;
