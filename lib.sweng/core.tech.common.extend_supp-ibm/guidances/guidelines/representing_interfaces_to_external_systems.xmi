    If the system communicates with another system, there will be one or more boundary classes identified in &lt;strong>Task:&#xD;
    Use Case Analysis&lt;/strong> to describe the communication protocol. An external system may be anything from software to&#xD;
    hardware units that the current system will use (such as printers, terminals, alarm devices, and sensors). In each&#xD;
    case, a boundary class will be identified whose purpose is to mediate the communication with the external system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Example&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) must communicate with the ATM Network to ascertain whether a customer's bank number&#xD;
    and PIN are correct, and whether they have sufficient funds in their account to effect a withdrawal. Since the ATM&#xD;
    Network is an external system (from the perspective of the ATM), you would use a &lt;b>boundary&lt;/b> class to represent it&#xD;
    in Use Case Analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the interface(s) to the system are simple and well-defined, a single class may be sufficient to represent the&#xD;
    external system. Often, however, these interfaces are too complex to be represented using a single class; they often&#xD;
    require complex collaborations of many classes. Moreover, interfaces between systems are often highly reusable across&#xD;
    applications. As a result, in many cases, a subsystem more appropriately models the system interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The use of a subsystem allows the interface to the external system to be defined and stabilized, while leaving the&#xD;
    design details of the system interface to remain hidden as its definition evolves.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
