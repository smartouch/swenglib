  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The flow of events of a use case describes what needs to be done by the system to provide value to an actor. It&#xD;
    consists of a sequence of tasks that together produce something for the actor. The flow of events consists of a basic&#xD;
    flow, and one or several alternative flows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The flow of events of a use case can be described graphically with the help of an activity diagram. Such a diagram&#xD;
    shows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Activity states&lt;/b>, which represent the performance of a task or step within the flow of events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Transitions&lt;/b> that show what activity state follows after another. This type of transition is sometimes&#xD;
        referred to as a completion transition, since it differs from a transition in that it does not require an explicit&#xD;
        trigger event, it is triggered by the completion of the task the activity state represents.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Decisions&lt;/b> for which a set of &lt;b>guard conditions&lt;/b> are defined. These guard conditions control which&#xD;
        transition (of a set of alternative transitions) follows once the task has been completed. Decisions and guard&#xD;
        conditions allow you to show &lt;b>alternative threads&lt;/b> in the flow of events of a use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Synchronization bars&lt;/b> which you can use to show parallel subflows. Synchronization bars allow you to show&#xD;
        &lt;b>concurrent threads&lt;/b> in the flow of events of a use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    A simplified activity diagram for the use case Withdraw Money in the use-case model of an automated teller machine&#xD;
    (ATM).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activity diagram is a special case of a statechart diagram in which all or most of the states are activity states and&#xD;
    in which all or most of the of the transitions are triggered by completion of actions in the source states.&#xD;
