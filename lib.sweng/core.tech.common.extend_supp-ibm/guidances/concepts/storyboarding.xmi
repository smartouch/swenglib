    &lt;strong>What is storyboarding&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Picture the scene...&quot;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    How often do we start a tale of fame and fortune, comedy or tragedy with this phrase? What follows is some description&#xD;
    that relates the story we want to tell. In software development, you have a story to tell too. You are building or&#xD;
    modifying software systems, in ways that are yet to be decided, or yet to be understood.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &quot;Actually, I can't picture the scene...&quot;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Most of the time you don't have that story firmly embedded in our mind. You don't understand the story, the background,&#xD;
    what happened before and what happens next. Even if you understand exactly what you are trying to do, no-one else has&#xD;
    exactly the same picture. Storyboarding is a technique used to capture and explain the story to those around you -&#xD;
    translating the ideas you might have in your head into something concrete that everyone can understand.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Storyboarding is not new. We have recently borrowed the concepts and techniques from the film industry as this is the&#xD;
    best-known examples of the use of storyboards. From a software development perspective, a storyboard is defined as&#xD;
    &quot;...a logical and conceptual description of system functionality for a specific scenario, including the interaction&#xD;
    required between the system users and the system. A Storyboard &quot;tells a specific story&quot;&quot; [RUP, 2008]&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This definition covers the use of storyboards as a way of capturing the way a solution behaves, as though you have&#xD;
    already solved the problem. A storyboard is also a way to explore the context of a system, and explore possible options&#xD;
    to solve the problem a system is designed to solve.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The task of building up storyboards is called storyboarding. &quot;Storyboarding is a technique for capturing logical and&#xD;
    conceptual description of system functionality for a specific scenario&quot;. [RUP, 2008]&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A storyboard typically shows the user interface drawn to show how the system will operate for a particular purpose.&#xD;
    Usually, a storyboard is a sequence of frames, where each frame has a description of the actions that lead to the next&#xD;
    frame. However, we are not trying to design a user interface - we are trying to illustrate the user experience. A film&#xD;
    storyboard will capture the flow of the scene, camera angles, and the characters, a software storyboard will capture&#xD;
    the main intent of the software in a particular context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Benefits of storyboarding&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Storyboarding can help us reduce project risks, and save time and money.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Customers don't always know what exactly they want. You will often hear them saying, &quot;I'll know it when I see it.&quot;&#xD;
    Storyboarding can help you resolve requirement uncertainties early in the development process. You can use these&#xD;
    uncertainties in requirements definition to determine when storyboarding will be useful, and gain agreement on what the&#xD;
    system should do by visualizing the requirements with storyboards.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Storyboarding helps eliciting, clarifying, completing, and validating requirements. Storyboarding encourages&#xD;
    stakeholder participation, and allows you to explore technical solution alternatives without coding. You can use&#xD;
    storyboards for interactive requirements/use case review sessions with stakeholders, and find what's missing, what's&#xD;
    wrong, what's unnecessary, and what's desired.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Storyboards can also be leveraged by designers, developers, testers, architect, and UI Designers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>What goes in a storyboard&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Persona&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    A persona describes a fictitious person, who is a user of a system. It represents the archetype of a user based on the&#xD;
    knowledge of real users. The goal is to bring the users to life by developing personas with real names, personalities,&#xD;
    motivations, and etc. You typically create several personas for a system. A persona is an instance of actor, and it can&#xD;
    be associated with multiple storyboards.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The purposes of describing a persona are:&lt;br />&#xD;
    • to ensure that you explore all the needs of your user base&lt;br />&#xD;
    • to act as &quot;user stand-ins&quot;, helping to guide your decisions about functionality and design&lt;br />&#xD;
    • to keep your storyboard focused on a very specific user context and user goal&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>Usage scenario&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    A usage scenario describes how a persona interact with a system to perform a specific task. It is driven by the user&#xD;
    needs and motivation of doing the task. It can be a summary of what the persona does in a storyboard before you create&#xD;
    it. If you do use-case driven development, a usage scenario is typically an instance of a complete use case scenario,&#xD;
    or a portion of the use case scenario.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;em>Storyboard&lt;/em>&lt;br />&#xD;
    A storyboard is a frame-by-frame depiction of a usage scenario, where each frame has a description of the actions that&#xD;
    lead to the next frame. It contains an in-depth walkthrough of a linear story represented as graphical frames on a&#xD;
    timeline with sample &quot;data&quot;.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
