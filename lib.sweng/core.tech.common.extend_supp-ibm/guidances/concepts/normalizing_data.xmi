&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This concept document provides a brief discussion of the topic of data normalization as it applies to the development&#xD;
    of the&amp;nbsp;data model.&amp;nbsp;It does not provide a full treatment of normalization, because the subject is quite broad&#xD;
    and has been documented in many texts on database design.&amp;nbsp;Normalization is defined as &quot;an analytic technique used&#xD;
    to produce a correct relational database design.&quot; In practice, normalization is a procedure for eliminating redundancy&#xD;
    in the data model by means of applying restrictive rules. Elimination of data redundancy in the tables of the Data&#xD;
    Model helps enforce referential integrity of the data in the database.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Normalization is usually performed on the Data Model after an initial version of the tables and their relationships has&#xD;
    been developed in the model.&amp;nbsp;The exact timing of when to apply normalization depends on the specific project&#xD;
    situation and is up to the database designer.&amp;nbsp;The normalization process is applied to the tables in the Data Model&#xD;
    in series of steps in which each step applies rules that are stricter than the last.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Levels of Normalization&quot; name=&quot;Levels of Normalization&quot;>&lt;/a>Levels of Normalization&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Normalization is hierarchically classified into numeric forms, with the most common being first, second, and third&#xD;
    normal form. Each level of normalization is more restrictive than the previous. The first three hierarchical levels of&#xD;
    normalization are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>First Normal Form&lt;/b>-Repeating groups of data columns in tables have been eliminated such that data is&#xD;
        organized into atomic units.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Second Normal Form&lt;/b>-Data is in first normal form, and redundancy on primary key fields has been eliminated&#xD;
        such that column values are wholly dependent on the primary key field.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Third Normal Form&lt;/b>-Data is in second normal form, and each column is not dependent on any other non-key&#xD;
        column.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other levels of normalization are possible but are not covered in this discussion.&amp;nbsp;The exact level of&#xD;
    normalization to apply to the Data Model is a decision that the database designer must make based on the specifics of&#xD;
    the project situation.&#xD;
