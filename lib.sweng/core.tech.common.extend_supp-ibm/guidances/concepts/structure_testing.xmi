    The concept of structural testing is used in two main contexts. Although different in nature, the root concept or idea&#xD;
    behind structure testing is arguably the same in both cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StructureofCode&quot; name=&quot;StructureofCode&quot;>Structure Testing of Code Internals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The older reference and perhaps more established use of the term &quot;structure testing&quot; relates to testing the internal&#xD;
    structure of the software source code. Most often, this form of structure testing is performed as a &quot;static&quot; as opposed&#xD;
    to a &quot;dynamic&quot; test, in that the software itself is not executed to perform the test. Diagnostic tools parse the source&#xD;
    code, looking for structural errors and weaknesses, typically providing a list to enable subsequent corrective action&#xD;
    to be taken. This type of test and evaluation is conducted by developers, rather than system testers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StructureofWebSites&quot; name=&quot;StructureofWebSites&quot;>Structure Testing of Web Sites&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Web-based applications-those employing Internet application technology-are increasingly more prevalent. This movement&#xD;
    has been encouraged by the fact that this software development and deployment method offers organizations the ability&#xD;
    to take advantage of several technology-enabled business benefits, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Developed audience of customers, prospects, and business partners without sending out a single piece of software&#xD;
        or paper&lt;i>.&lt;/i>&lt;/b> Anyone with a browser and access to the &quot;net&quot; (Internet or Intranet) can simply point their&#xD;
        browser to the published URL and immediately run the application.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Centralized control and maintenance.&lt;/b> The &quot;thin-client/fat-server&quot; model of Web-based applications places the&#xD;
        application components and logic on the Web server, which centralizes and simplifies control and maintenance. This&#xD;
        also enables developers to distribute the software automatically. Once the application is on the server, it is&#xD;
        immediately available for all users.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although this offers advantages to those who employ this technology, Web-based applications increase the demands of&#xD;
    testing. Testing these Web-based applications, like their non-Web counterparts (client/server, legacy, and so forth),&#xD;
    requires testing to address the function and performance characteristics of the applications. In addition, Web-based&#xD;
    applications have the added need for tests that focus on the structure of the application, ensuring it's well-formed&#xD;
    and that all links are valid.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically Web-based applications are constructed using a series of documents (both HTML text documents and GIF/JPEG&#xD;
    graphics) connected by many static links and a few active, or program-controlled, links. These applications may also&#xD;
    include &quot;active content&quot;, such as forms, Java scripts, plug-in-rendered content, or Java applications. Frequently this&#xD;
    active content is used for output only, such as for audio or video presentation. However, it may also be used as a&#xD;
    navigation aid, to help the user navigate the application (Web site). The freeform nature of the Web-based applications&#xD;
    (through its links) is a great strength, but it's also a tremendous weakness because structural integrity can be easily&#xD;
    damaged.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Structure testing is implemented and executed to verify that all links (static or active) are properly connected. These&#xD;
    tests include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Verifying that the proper content (text, graphics, and so on) for each link is displayed.&lt;/b> Different types of&#xD;
        links are used to reference target-content in Web-based applications, such as bookmarks, hyperlinks to other target&#xD;
        content (in the same or different Web site), or hot spots. Each link needs to be verified to ensure that the&#xD;
        correct target-content is presented to the user.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Ensuring there are no broken links.&lt;/b> Broken links are those links for which the target content cannot be&#xD;
        found. Links may be broken for many reasons, including moving, removing, or renaming the target-content files.&#xD;
        Links may also be broken because of improper syntax use, including missing slashes, colons, or letters.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Verifying there is no orphaned content.&lt;/b> Orphaned content are those files for which there is no &quot;inbound&quot;&#xD;
        link in the current Web site; that is, there is no way to access or present the content. Care must be taken to&#xD;
        investigate orphaned content to determine the cause: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Is it orphaned because it is truly no longer needed?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Is it orphaned due to a broken link?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Or is it accessed by a link external to the current Web site?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once determined, the appropriate action should be taken, such as remove the content file, repair the broken link, or&#xD;
    ignore the orphan, respectively.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
