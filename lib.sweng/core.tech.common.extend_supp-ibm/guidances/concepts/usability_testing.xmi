    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;How to Expose the Design&quot; name=&quot;How to Expose the Design&quot;>Ways of Exposing the Design&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One way of exposing a user-interface design is to have a business or system analyst sit with the user in front of the&#xD;
    interface. Walk through a common scenario; for example, a use case's basic flow with typical values you described in a&#xD;
    use-case storyboard. Encourage the person to ask questions and give comments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The challenge with this approach is to ensure the information you obtain is as unbiased as possible. To do this, you&#xD;
    need to make sure the questions you ask are context-free. Take as many notes as you can. If possible, have someone else&#xD;
    do this so you don't interrupt the user's natural flow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another way of exposing the user-interface design is to perform use tests. These are often conducted as a lab or&#xD;
    workshop with representatives from the end-user community. In a use test, real users perform real tasks with the&#xD;
    interface, and the software development staff typically takes a passive, observational role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A lot of value can be gained from this type of usability testing, however, there are a number of challenges that must&#xD;
    be faced and tradeoffs that must be made to get reliable, economic results:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As a general rule, this approach has the most value if the end-user community is large, varied, and has a great&#xD;
        degree of control over selecting their software system. In the presence of these factors, the risk of not&#xD;
        performing use tests increases. Often the greater the value in performing these tests, the harder it is to gain&#xD;
        access to, coordinate, and manage this activity with the end user.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It's important to identify the most common usage patterns, discounting outlier and exceptional results, to ensure&#xD;
        that the user-interface design decisions are based on the needs of the majority. To do this, you need both broad&#xD;
        and deep sample data, which usually requires a large amount of gathering and collating effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where users must migrate from an existing legacy system to a new system, they are often concerned that the new&#xD;
        system will provide less functionality than that provided by the old one. Unfortunately, this issue is seldom&#xD;
        raised directly, and is often concealed by comments such as &quot;I want the new system to look and feel exactly the way&#xD;
        the existing system does&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &amp;nbsp;Where a significant change in technology is being proposed to an end-user community, it may be necessary to&#xD;
        provide training in the basic use of the technology before significant value will be gained from use testing. For&#xD;
        example, legacy system users may have had no previous experience using a mouse or working with a GUI.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each project team needs to consider these challenges against the unique project environment they are working within to&#xD;
    arrive at the appropriate timing, method, and approach to usability testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Stakeholders&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's very important to expose the user interface to others. As the design and implementation of the interface&#xD;
    progresses, you expose the design to increasing numbers of reviewers, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        other project members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        external usability experts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        users&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To get valuable feedback, you don't always have to go through formal use tests where real users perform real tasks. An&#xD;
    important class of user-interface defects are caused by the &lt;i>home blindness&lt;/i> of the user-interface designer-anyone&#xD;
    who wasn't involved in the user-interface design should be able to identify most of these defects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Exposing the Design to Other Project Members&quot; name=&quot;Exposing the Design to Other Project Members&quot;>Other&#xD;
    Project Members&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an underestimated way of exposing the design. It has a very fast turnaround time: project members are already&#xD;
    familiar with the application and usually they're available for a spontaneous usability session without tremendous&#xD;
    ceremony or formality. User-interface designers should do this continuously during the design activity to cure their&#xD;
    own &lt;i>home blindness&lt;/i>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Exposing the Design to External Usability Experts&quot; name=&quot;Exposing the Design to External Usability Experts&quot;>External Usability Experts&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good usability expert can help to reduce development effort by pointing out common usability flaws, and usually&#xD;
    offers other perspectives on the user interface based on experience. It can be valuable to involve external usability&#xD;
    experts early in the user-interface design work, so there's sufficient time to refactor the design to incorporate their&#xD;
    recommendations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;

&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Exposing prototypes to users is generally a good use of your time. Because access to users is often limited, it's worth&#xD;
    getting feedback on prototypes when the opportunity arises. Do this as often as necessary to gain the stakeholders'&#xD;
    approval and to correct any misinterpretation of the stakeholders' needs. This can occur either during requirements&#xD;
    capture or user-interface design. Wherever possible, avoid exposing the same user to the interface more than once-the&#xD;
    second time, the user will be tainted by your earlier design ideas (similar to &lt;i>home blindness&lt;/i>), and, as such,&#xD;
    the value of the activity is diminished.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also, when you expose a software prototype to users, be careful to set the expectations correctly. If you don't, users&#xD;
    may have expectations that they'll experience the full behavior of the functioning system behind the user interface.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
