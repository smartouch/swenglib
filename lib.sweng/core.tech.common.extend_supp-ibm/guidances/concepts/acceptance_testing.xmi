  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Acceptance testing is the final test action before deploying the software. The goal of acceptance testing is to verify&#xD;
    that the software is ready and can be used by your users to perform those functions and tasks for which the software&#xD;
    was built. There are three common strategies for implementing an acceptance test. They are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Formal%20Acceptance%20Testing&quot;>Formal acceptance&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Informal%20Acceptance%20Testing&quot;>Informal acceptance or alpha test&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Beta%20Testing&quot;>Beta test&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy you select is often based on the contractual requirements, organizational and corporate standards, and&#xD;
    application domain.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Formal Acceptance Testing&quot; name=&quot;Formal Acceptance Testing&quot;>Formal Acceptance Testing&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Formal acceptance testing is a highly managed process and is often an extension of the system test. The tests are&#xD;
    planned and designed as carefully as, and in the same detail as, system testing. The test cases chosen should be a&#xD;
    subset of those performed in system test. It's important not to deviate in any way from the chosen test cases. In many&#xD;
    organizations, formal acceptance testing is fully automated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tasks and work products are the same as for system testing. In some organizations, the development organization (or&#xD;
    its independent test group), with the representatives of the end-user organization, performs the acceptance test. In&#xD;
    other organizations, acceptance testing is performed completely by the end-user organization or an objective group of&#xD;
    people chosen by the end-user organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The benefits of this form of testing are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The functions and features to be tested are known.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The details of the tests are known and can be measured.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tests can be automated, which permits regression testing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The progress of the tests can be measured and monitored.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The acceptability criteria are known.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The disadvantages include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requires significant resources and planning.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tests may be a re-implementation of system tests.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The testing may not uncover subjective defects in the software, since you're only looking for defects you expect to&#xD;
        find.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Informal Acceptance Testing&quot; name=&quot;Informal Acceptance Testing&quot;>Informal Acceptance Testing&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In informal acceptance testing, the test procedures for performing the test are not as rigorously defined as for formal&#xD;
    acceptance testing. The functions and business activities to be explored are identified and documented, but there are&#xD;
    no particular test cases to follow. The individual tester determines what to do. This approach to acceptance testing is&#xD;
    not as controlled as formal testing and is more subjective than the formal one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Informal acceptance testing is most frequently performed by the end-user organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The benefits of this form of testing are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The functions and features to be tested are known.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The progress of the tests can be measured and monitored.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The acceptability criteria are known.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You will uncover more subjective defects than with formal acceptance testing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The disadvantages include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resources, planning, and management resources are required.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You have no control over what test cases are used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        users may conform to the way the system works and not see the defects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        users might focus on comparing the new system to a legacy system, rather than looking for defects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resources for acceptance testing are not under the control of the project and could be constricted.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Beta Testing&quot; name=&quot;Beta Testing&quot;>Beta Testing&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Beta testing is the least controlled of the three acceptance test strategies. In beta testing, the amount of detail,&#xD;
    the data, and the approach taken is entirely up to the individual tester. Each tester is responsible for creating his&#xD;
    or her own environment, selecting his or her data, and determining what functions, features, or tasks to explore. Each&#xD;
    tester is responsible for identifying his or her own criteria for whether to accept the system in its current state or&#xD;
    not.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Beta testing is implemented by users, often with little or no management from the development (or other non end-user)&#xD;
    organization. Beta testing is the most subjective of all acceptance test strategies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The benefits of this form of testing are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Testing is implemented by users.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There are large volumes of potential test resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There is increased customer satisfaction for those who participate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You uncover more subjective defects than with formal or informal acceptance testing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The disadvantages include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You might not test all functions or features.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test progress is difficult to measure.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        users might conform to the way the system works and not see or report the defects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        users may focus on comparing the new system to a legacy system, rather than looking for defects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resources for acceptance testing are not under the control of the project and could be constricted.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Acceptability criteria are not known.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You need increased support resources to manage the beta testers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
