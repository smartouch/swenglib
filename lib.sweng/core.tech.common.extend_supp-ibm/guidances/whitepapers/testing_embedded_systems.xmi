    Vincent Encontre is the Director for Embedded and RealTime, Automated Testing Business Unit, based in Rational's new&#xD;
    engineering center in Toulouse, France. When he's not traveling, attending meetings, or answering zillions of emails,&#xD;
    Vincent looks at the destiny of Rational Test RealTime as a Rational product and as reusable technologies for next&#xD;
    generations of Rational products. Vincent has extensive experience in embedded modeling and testing technologies and&#xD;
    practices. Prior to Rational and ATTOL, Vincent spent 13 years at Philips, then at Verilog, designing, marketing, and&#xD;
    supporting software engineering tools, believing these tools could help build better software faster.&lt;br />&#xD;
    In his spare time, Vincent plays soccer with his three boys and a few others, and just enjoys the wonderful art de&#xD;
    vivre from the south of France (before it's too late...).&#xD;

    Abstract&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This paper gives a general introduction to testing embedded systems followed by a discussion of how embedded systems'&#xD;
    issues affect testing processes and technologies, and how Rational Test RealTime provides solutions to these issues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It presents an overview of the process of six incremental steps used to test embedded systems. Considering this process&#xD;
    (taking into account the full spectrum from very small to very large systems), and the specific characteristics and&#xD;
    constraints of embedded systems, we have deduced a set of requirements that an ideal technology must possess to address&#xD;
    the testing of embedded systems. Rational Test RealTime, the new Rational offering to the embedded systems domain,&#xD;
    exemplifies large portions of this ideal technology. &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
