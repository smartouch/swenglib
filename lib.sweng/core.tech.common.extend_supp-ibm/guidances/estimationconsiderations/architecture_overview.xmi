    The effort you need to create an Architecture Overview for a system depends on the size and complexity of the project&#xD;
    and how much research you must perform during its development. Typically, there are a number of steps involved in&#xD;
    creating an Architecture Overview.&amp;nbsp; Each step has a range for the amount of effort required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a moderately complex project, below is a summary of the steps involved with an estimate of the effort for each&#xD;
    step:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the functional and non-functional requirements.&amp;nbsp; The effort&amp;nbsp;depends on whether there are&#xD;
        adequate requirements documents, how large and complex these are, and whether the same people who documented&#xD;
        requirements are involved in architecture definition. Familiarization time could be zero if personnel defined the&#xD;
        requirements.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, two people might be able to familiarize themselves in two days each.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Research industry literature, assets, and previous engagements that might be relevant.&amp;nbsp; Effort expended here&#xD;
        can reduce subsequent effort and risk.&amp;nbsp; Research can be conducted for up to five days.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Envision alternative system architectures.&amp;nbsp; You can do this best by conducting in a workshop session.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        This might take five people for one day each.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Evaluate alternative solutions and decide which to adopt.&amp;nbsp; The effort for his depends on the number of&#xD;
        alternatives, the extent to which each alternative is elaborated, and the diversity of stakeholders and conflicting&#xD;
        requirements.&amp;nbsp; In a small project this could be performed as part of the envisioning workshop.&amp;nbsp; This&#xD;
        effort could take from one to twenty days, depending on the complexity of the nuances involved.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Document the agreed upon Architecture Overview, which might take approximately one&#xD;
        day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
