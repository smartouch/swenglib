        The design organized in a way that team members can easily find the information they're looking for.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each diagram help the designer reason about the design, or communicate key design decisions to the team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The design as simple as it can be while fulfilling the objectives of the design and giving sufficient direction to&#xD;
        implementers or those who must maintain the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The design neither too simple nor too advanced, the design sophistication should be appropriate to the experience&#xD;
        level of other team members and technical stakeholders. This applies to both the design conceptually and the&#xD;
        representation of the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each diagram complete and minimal,&amp;nbsp;it shows everything relevant to that view and nothing more.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The diagrams tidy and easy to interpret, with a minimum of clutter.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The relationships between diagrams are clear when several diagrams are used to describe behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            It is easy to understand related diagrams&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The design follows established design standards and&amp;nbsp;applies other idioms consistently.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The visual model conform to project or organization specific modeling standards.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The names of the design elements are consistent and easy to interpret.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        No&amp;nbsp;part of the design contradicts another part of it in such a way as to put the project at risk.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The visual model is internally consistent.&amp;nbsp; For instance, if an object diagram shows a relationship between&#xD;
        objects, does a corresponding relationship exist between the appropriate classes?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The notation used to describe the design is used consistently and unambiguously.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        The design is structured well enough to be maintained.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The design is set up to appropriately to accommodate expected changes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Note that the design should not&#xD;
        be overdone to handle any possible change, just reasonably expected changes.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If this is an up-front design, redundant areas of the design been removed so the implementation does not contain&#xD;
        redundant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        The package partitioning is logical and consistent so that&amp;nbsp;it makes sense to other team members and&#xD;
        stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The package names accurately describe the contents of the package and the role they play in the architecture&#xD;
        and&amp;nbsp;follow naming established conventions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Public packages and interfaces provide a logically cohesive set of services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All the contents of&amp;nbsp;each package listed and the classes within a package are cohesive.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package dependencies correspond to the dependencies of the contained classes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Packages or classes within a package have been separated into an independent package or sub-packages as&#xD;
        appropriate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each diagram focuses on a relevant perspective.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For instance, does a set of diagrams show a single class&#xD;
        and its direct relationships, rather than using one or two diagrams to show all classes?&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        The design conforms to the architecture as specified with&amp;nbsp;each component realization tracing back to its&#xD;
        associated component specification documented in the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It clear how the design elements relate back to the requirements and&amp;nbsp;it is clear what portions of the&#xD;

        others.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The design is organized in a way that helps team members modify it without contending for the same part of the&#xD;

        There is a component realization for each component specification in the architecture.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each component realization explains how the design realizes its component specification - sufficiently describing&#xD;
