    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Given disruption to the customer's normal operation in-migrating to the solution, is there a contingency plan if&#xD;
        initial migration to the solution does not work?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the appropriate system management disciplines in place for the solution?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Does the client have the capability to support the solution once IBM has completed the project?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Will the solution design initial and on going costs meet client budget and ROI objectives?&amp;nbsp; Does the project&#xD;
        team understand the cost ramifications of the solution?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
