  <mainDescription>This artifact&amp;nbsp;may include such items as which files are required, which links must be in place, which libraries are&#xD;
accessed, the sequence of steps required to generate the system, decisions and rationale for all integration procedures, or&#xD;
any required passwords.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a very straightforward work product.&amp;nbsp; Write the build procedures so any team member can follow them.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If security is an issue, ensure that the team knows where and how to get the password.&amp;nbsp; One solution is letting&#xD;
    the project manager keep passwords in a sealed envelope in a secure location. However, the proper people must be aware&#xD;
    of how to gain access to this location, if necessary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can test the Build Procedures by having a team member unfamiliar with the process walk through the&#xD;
    procedures.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>Build Procedures are documented to ensure that the procedures can be executed at any time by the development team without&#xD;
depending on particular team members.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Undocumented build procedures can lead to confusion and chaos during system builds. If the procedures are unrecorded, there&#xD;
is a risk of building incorrect or incomplete copies of the system, resulting in easily avoidable delays.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Build procedures should always be developed to guide builds and releases. They should never exist only in someone's head.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>Build procedures can be written as textual guidance, most often as a checklist and/or sequence of steps.&amp;nbsp; They may&#xD;
also be automated using a tool such as IBM Rational Build Forge(R).</representationOptions>
