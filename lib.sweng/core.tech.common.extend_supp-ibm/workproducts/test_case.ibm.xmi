  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    1. &lt;strong>Test Case Description&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>A description of the purpose or objective of the test, the scope, and any preconditions of the test&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. &lt;strong>Execution Condition&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>A description of a condition that will be exercised during this test&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    a. &lt;strong>Preconditions&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    For each execution condition, describe the required state that the system should be in before the test can commence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    b. &lt;strong>Test Inputs&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    For each execution condition, enumerate a list of the specific stimuli to be applied during the test. This is generally&#xD;
    referred to as the &lt;i>Inputs&lt;/i> to the test, and includes the objects or fields interacted with (and the specific data&#xD;
    values entered) when executing this Test Case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    c. &lt;strong>Observation Points&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    During the test execution, enumerate what specific observations should be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    d. &lt;strong>Control Points&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    During the test execution, identify any points where the flow of control may alter or vary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    e. &lt;strong>Expected Results&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    The resulting state or observable conditions that are expected as a result of the test having been executed. This may&#xD;
    cover both positive and negative responses (such as error conditions and failures).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    f. &lt;strong>Postconditions&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>For each execution condition, describe the required state that the system should be returned to, allowing&#xD;
    subsequent tests to be performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In certain domains and testing cultures, Test Cases are considered optional work products, whereas in others they are&#xD;
    highly formalized and mandatory. As such, both the contents and format of Test Cases may require modification to meet&#xD;
    the needs of your specific organization or project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When they are recorded (both formally and informally), two main styles are followed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first is a standard text document structure using a format similar to that previously outlined in the Brief&#xD;
    Outline. Often, multiple Test Case instances or variations are specified in a single document, grouped by the general&#xD;
    purpose or objective of the tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second style uses some form of table or database. Test-Case instances are specified, one per row, with columns&#xD;
    provided to facilitate sorting and filtering by different criteria.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Some consideration should also be given to ongoing measurement of the test cases for progress, effectiveness, and so&#xD;
    on. Consider requirements-based test coverage, in which each Test Case traces back to at least one test idea and at&#xD;
    least one system requirement, which represents a subset of the Product requirements (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/concepts/key_measure_test_2CC7496.html&quot; guid=&quot;_AhYiUHHVEdyzS55ez-koKA&quot;>Concept: Key Measures of Test&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As mentioned, it is typical for multiple Test Case instances or variations to be specified in a single document,&#xD;
    usually grouped by the general purpose or objective of the tests. This may be realized as multiple execution conditions&#xD;
    described within the one document, one per unique Test Case instance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, the Test Case can be enclosed partially or completely within the Test Ideas List or Test Script.&#xD;
