  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;include the tasks executed, the job function that performs the task, and the technology (both&#xD;
    applications (or tool) and data) that is used to perform the task. In addition, the work product clearly describes the&#xD;
    relationship of the tasks to the job functions and the technology. This work product has the following characteristics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The job functions are shown using the defined job names of those jobs participating in the execution of the tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools/applications are named and, ideally, specific functions and/or user interfaces are referenced.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The data fields used for each task are named and their source is identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The flow of information from one task to another is identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tasks are shown in time sequence.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Optionally, time estimates for the completion of each task are indicated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The review of the high-level service design at the beginning of the development of this work product provides the&#xD;
    opportunity to educate new project team members and have them understand the solution as designed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on how the IT Services Detailed Design work product output is going to be used, it may not be necessary to&#xD;
    develop the workflow charts (e.g. LOVEM charts).&amp;nbsp; The narratives and task/job/data/tool table may be sufficient to&#xD;
    meet the requirements of the engagement.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product is created to completely define the IT Services for the solution. It is the final level of detail&#xD;
    created during the design of the solution. It will be used as input into the development of the solution, especially in&#xD;
    the writing of procedures, the customization of applications and data and the writing of user guides.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product can be used to communicate the final detailed specifications of the capability solution to the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this work product, the details of the solution may be left unclear. As the development proceeds unnecessary time&#xD;
may be spent in rework, because the solution development may not be meeting the required specifications.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This work product may not be needed if the solution being developed requires only a small degree of customization, or if&#xD;
capability will be executed in an informal fashion.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work product will normally consist of two components:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation of the specific tasks, tools, jobs and data associated to each other. It is recommended to gather&#xD;
        this data in a table.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workflow charts to visualize the flow of the tasks in time sequence and associate the jobs and tools. There are&#xD;
        several methods how to develop the charts (flowcharts, IDEF0, LOVEM, etc.). What to choose will depend on:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;list-style: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                reuse of intellectual capital.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                experience of the project team members.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                standard method use by the client.&lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol></briefOutline>
