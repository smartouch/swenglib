  <mainDescription>The Test Ideas List provides a layer of abstraction between the conceptual Test Plan and the more detailed Test Case (or the&#xD;
concrete Test Script). It is used to capture initial ideas for potential tests (often ill-formed or partial ideas) so that the&#xD;
tests can be reasoned about. This work product is particularly useful earlier in the development cycle, or when supporting&#xD;
project work products are unavailable or incomplete.</mainDescription>
  <purpose>To help reason about tests and testing early in the project.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a&amp;nbsp;preliminary list of tests covering a specific test scope is not captured in a standalone artifact, the&#xD;
    alternative is to provide this information either in a test plan or as part of the test cases description.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>In some cases these lists will be informally defined and discarded after the test scripts or test cases have been defined&#xD;
from them.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each Test Ideas List should be identified by considering as many different perspectives as possible, including many of&#xD;
    the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have all relevant test idea catalogs been reviewed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any quality risks not represented on the list?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any relevant fault models not represented on the list?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have you considered the use of all possible attacks?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have you considered one or more relevant soap operas?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any other ideas that strike you as worth considering?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the relative importance of each idea in the list?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
     One you have an initial list of ideas, consider whether there any related ideas on the list that could be combined or&#xD;
    consolidated. As a general heuristic, most lists should contain seven entries, plus or minus two. For more detail on&#xD;
    the contents of a Test Ideas List, see the guidelines listed under the More Information section of the header table.&#xD;
&lt;/p></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In certain domains and testing cultures, Test Ideas are either not recognized, or are considered informal work&#xD;
    products. As such, both the contents and format of Test Ideas Lists may require modification to meet the needs of each&#xD;
    specific organization and project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When they are recorded (either formally or informally), two main styles are commonly used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first is a standard text document structure using a format similar to that outlined above. Usually multiple Test&#xD;
    Ideas are to be presented together, whereas a single Test Idea by itself is usually not considered to represent a&#xD;
    sufficient list.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second uses some form of table or database. Test Ideas are specified, one per row with columns provided to&#xD;
    facilitate sorting and filtering by different criteria. Test matrices (or cause and effect tables) can be considered&#xD;
    alternative forms of the Test Ideas List.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Some consideration should also be given to ongoing measurement of the Test Ideas for progress, effectiveness, change&#xD;
    management, and so on. Consider using specification-based test coverage, in which each Test Idea or Test Ideas List&#xD;
    traces back to at least one specification entry to be tested. For example, trace to the requirements specification&#xD;
    elements to be tested, which will typically reflect some subset of the total product requirements (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/concepts/key_measure_test_2CC7496.html&quot; guid=&quot;_AhYiUHHVEdyzS55ez-koKA&quot;>Concept: Key Measures of Test&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, the Test Ideas can be retained as part of a Test Case or Test Script. The list may also be referenced&#xD;
    from (or in smaller test efforts, included in) the Test Plan.&#xD;
