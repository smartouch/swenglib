  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Strategy is used to identify testing principles and practices that will be applied in order to mitigate the&#xD;
    project risks, manage the testing risks, and identify any exposures. This artifact provides a common approach and&#xD;
    terminology for the testing effort. It also gives a general direction of where the testing is headed. It emphasizes the&#xD;
    importance of a team approach to testing.&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To convey the strategy to external stakeholders to gain their agreement to the approach&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To convey the strategy to the internal members of the test team to enable a coordinated team effort&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To convince management and other stakeholders that the approach is sound and achievable&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the beginning of a project, it may be very difficult to embark on any test planning effort until details of the&#xD;
    solution start to emerge. To overcome this difficulty, a high-level strategy is developed to understand the testing&#xD;
    implications and verify the feasibility of testing the solution. Without a clear understanding of the testing&#xD;
    requirements, the best solution alternative may not be selected, and without appropriate testing, even the best&#xD;
    solution cannot be implemented with a high degree of assurance that it will function as expected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the test strategy is not produced, these issues&amp;nbsp;need to be addressed by using test plans.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually for small projects, this artifact may not always be created. A single test strategy per project or per phase&#xD;
    within a project is recommended in most cases. Optionally, you might reuse existing strategies where appropriate, or&#xD;
    you might further subdivide the test strategies based on the type of testing that you are conducting.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Strategy captures the following informational elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An explanation of the general approach that will be used. For example, explain how the primary approach is based on&#xD;
        verifying the software against requirements or design specifications, exercising the software against fault models,&#xD;
        subjecting the software to known attacks, or some other general approach.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The specific types, techniques, and styles of testing that will be employed as part of the strategy, and for each:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;ul>&#xD;
                &lt;li>&#xD;
                    An indication of the scope and applicability of the technique&#xD;
                &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;li>&#xD;
                    An outline of how the technique will be employed&#xD;
                &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;li>&#xD;
                    An outline of what tools will be required to support the technique&#xD;
                &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;li>&#xD;
                    The criteria for measuring the success and ongoing value of employing the technique&#xD;
                &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;li>&#xD;
                    An indication of the weaknesses or limitations of the technique, and where any other techniques will&#xD;
                    cover this&#xD;
                &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;/ul>&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    For a specific software system in a given context (technology, domain, and so forth), it is likely that the strategy&#xD;
    can be reused (in whole or in part) in subsequent development lifecycles.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In certain testing cultures, the Test Strategy is considered an informal, casual work product, whereas in others it is&#xD;
    highly formalized and often requires external signoff. As such, the format and content should be varied to meet the&#xD;
    specific needs of the project or organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an alternative to formal documentation, you might choose to only record the elements of the Test Strategy as a set&#xD;
    of informal planning notes, possibly maintained on an intranet Web site or whiteboard readily visible to, and&#xD;
    accessible by, the test team.&#xD;
