  <impactOfNotHaving>This is a key artifact which enables the communication between the main stakeholders. Without its summary of findings and&#xD;
risks, showing the progress against quality measures as defined in the detailed test plans, there are significantly greater&#xD;
opportunities for misunderstandings. These misunderstandings may lead to reduced product quality. If no formal test&#xD;
reporting is to be done, frequent and consistent informal communication is necessary, particularly of defect management&#xD;
activity and its implications for the project. It would be wise to keep an informal record of these communications as well.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>In small or very automated testing projects, there may be less need for formalized reporting at any point in time or at&#xD;
milestones, although a conclusive set of findings should not be omitted. In these circumstances, it is assumed that&#xD;
informal communication or automated reporting will provide the project team with a clear picture of test status.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The level of formality and presentation format for this work product vary widely. Some produce simple text document&#xD;
    reports, whereas others produce full-fledged presentations. Both formats may be useful to emphasize certain critical&#xD;
    test cycles and de-emphasize others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Evaluation Summary may be enclosed as part of another evaluation document (such as an iteration assessment or&#xD;
    review record).&#xD;
