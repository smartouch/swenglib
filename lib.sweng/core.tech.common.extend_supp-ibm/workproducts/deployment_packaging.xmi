  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product includes things required to run the system, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Executables (for example, .exe files on OS/2)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Load libraries (for example, .dll files on OS/2)&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Runtime images (for example, .vkg .exe)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        .dll and image files (for example, those that make up a VisualAge application on OS/2)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It can also include other things, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation instructions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User help materials, such as tutorials or reference guides&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Warranty registration cards&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actual packaging (such as a box or envelope) which contains the items being distributed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Knowing the environment and experience level of the intended audience is essential. Therefore, before producing mass&#xD;
    quantities, it is best to mock up a single copy and do a test with someone similar to the intended audience. Clarity,&#xD;
    accuracy, and completeness are key requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Always provide some sort of contact point for people who will receive copies of the package. This could be a telephone&#xD;
    number staffed by someone who can answer questions about the content of the package and its use.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product is comprised of&amp;nbsp;the items required for installation and deployment of the system and for a&#xD;
    successful conclusion of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It clarifies an important category (and possibly the most important category) of the project, namely those work&#xD;
    products required for successful installation and execution of the system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without careful and prescribed packaging, you risk forgetting to include something that is required for the successful&#xD;
deployment of the system.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>If the system is installed in one site only by the development team then there may not be a need for this work product.&#xD;
However, any time the installation is done by persons other than the development team, develop this work product.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline xsi:nil="true"/>
  <representationOptions>This work product is usually specified on a text-based checklist.&amp;nbsp; The packaging itself can be physical packaging&#xD;
(such as box containing paper documentation and physical media), or can be a downloadable package of software and&#xD;
documentation.</representationOptions>
