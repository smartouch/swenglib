  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;
    decisions about what testing will be undertaken, and how the test effort will be conducted.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To outline and communicate the intent of the testing effort for a given schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To gain the acceptance and approval of the stakeholders in the test effort&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Higher level plans for testing, such as a master test plan, are not executable, as they do not have detailed level&#xD;
    activities or tasks. Without task level details, resources and time schedules to carry out those tasks, it will be&#xD;
    difficult, if not impossible, to execute, track, manage and control them. Different levels of tests focus on different&#xD;
    areas of functionality and risk, and different organizational units may own responsibility. Thus without detailed test&#xD;
    plans organized around your main test cycles or iterations,&amp;nbsp;it will be difficult for different organizational&#xD;
    units to plan, prepare, execute and report testing without actually increasing risk. Eliminating detailed test plans,&#xD;
    especially for large projects, will virtually guarantee project failure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The creation of detailed test plans is also the activity that is most often underestimated in projects. It must start&#xD;
    as soon as pre-requisites are available to ensure that testing requirements and dependencies are identified early and&#xD;
    are addressed appropriately. Delaying the start of this activity often leads to project schedule overruns and increased&#xD;
    business or technical risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the main factors&amp;nbsp;driving the granularity of your test plans are test levels and test&amp;nbsp;types, then not all&#xD;
    these factors are relevant during the duration of a project and therefore some specialized test plans will not be&#xD;
    developed or will be limited to just a few test cycles or iterations. In cases where projects are small, with&#xD;
    well-defined scope and structure, and all project members are co-located or work closely together, there may be one&#xD;
    joint test plan that covers the high level plan and all detail levels of testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan captures the following informational elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The definition of the goals and objectives of the test effort within the scope of the iteration (or project)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The definition of the the targeted test items&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An explanation of the approach or strategy that will be used&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Entry and exit criteria that can&amp;nbsp;be used to determine the&amp;nbsp;starting and ending time&amp;nbsp;for the execution&#xD;
        of&amp;nbsp;the Test Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The required resources and schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The deliverables to be produced&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In certain testing cultures, Test Plans are considered informal, casual work products, whereas in others they are&#xD;
    highly formal and often require external signoff. As such, the format and content of the work product should be varied&#xD;
    to meet the specific needs of an organization or project. Start by considering the templates included with the IBM&amp;reg;&#xD;
    Rational Unified Process&amp;reg; (RUP&amp;reg;) approach, and remove, add, or modify elements from the template as needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an alternative to formal documentation, you might choose to record the elements of the Test Plan as a set of&#xD;
    informal planning notes, possibly maintained on an intranet Web site or whiteboard readily visible to, and accessible&#xD;
    by, the test team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, some aspects of this work product can be presented appropriately as enclosures within other plans (for&#xD;
    example a project plan, release plan, or iteration plan), rather than as a separate work products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We recommend that you create smaller Test Plans focused on the scope of a single iteration. These work products should&#xD;
    contain the information related to the specific Test Motivators (for example, a subset of requirements and risks), the&#xD;
    specific test ideas you will investigate, strategies you will use, resources available, and so forth, relevant to the&#xD;
    specific Iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, a Master Test Plan may be created at the outset of the project to provide an outline of the planned test&#xD;
    effort over the life of the project, and provide some forethought into resource requirements and other long-term&#xD;
    logistics concerns. This master work product also provides a way to limit the repetition of elements common to all Test&#xD;
    Plans, such as human, hardware, and software resources, management procedures, and so on. We recommend that you avoid&#xD;
    documenting specific detailed test information in the Test Plan, documenting that as necessary and appropriate in other&#xD;
    more appropriate test work products.&#xD;
