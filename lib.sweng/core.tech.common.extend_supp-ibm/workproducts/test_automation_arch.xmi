  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Automation Architecture provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the test-automation system, using a&#xD;
    number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It serves as a means of reasoning&#xD;
    about, managing, and communicating the fundamental characteristics and features of the test-automation software system.&#xD;
    It provides a governing focus for the test-automation software that enables the required system to be realized in&#xD;
    respect to key aspects such as: maintainability, extensibility, reliability, concurrency, distribution, security, and&#xD;
    recovery.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To provide a means of reasoning about, managing, and communicating the fundamental characteristics of the test-automation&#xD;

  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For larger test organizations, not capturing the test automation architecture may lead to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Less efficiency in using the test resources&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Overlaps in developing automated tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maintenance issues over a longer period of time&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Recommended on projects where the test architecture is relatively complex, when a large number of staff members will be&#xD;
collaborating on building automated tests, or when the test automation system is expected to be maintained over a long&#xD;
period of time. In some cases, this might simply be a whiteboard diagram that is recorded centrally for interested parties&#xD;
to consult.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>UML Representation: &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some aspects of the Test Automation Architecture can optionally be described using a UML model, stereotyped as&#xD;
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;test automation architecture&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Tailoring&quot; name=&quot;Tailoring&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where available, you may be able to make use of some part of the existing Test Automation Architectures with little&#xD;
    need to tailor them. However, usually each project requires some variation in approach, techniques, and tools, which&#xD;
    ultimately affects the Test Automation Architecture itself. In many cases, tailoring or creating an appropriate Test&#xD;
    Automation Architecture will occur during the Elaboration phase, and will be fine-tuned and extended with each&#xD;
    subsequent iteration (in both the Construction and Transition phases).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the definition of Test Automation Architecture, it can be helpful to use a single source that maintains an outline&#xD;
    description of the main characteristics of the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an alternative to formal documentation, you may choose to simply record this information as a set of informal&#xD;
    architectural notes accompanied by a minimal set of explanatory diagrams, possibly maintained on a white-board readily&#xD;
    visible to the test team.&#xD;
