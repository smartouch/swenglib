  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment&#xD;
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to&#xD;
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional&#xD;
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Operational Modeling Terminology&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3&#xD;
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actors (and workers) - the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Locations - a geographical area or position.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Borders - representing the existing connection between two locations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment Units - a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connectors - enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interactions - identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a&#xD;
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within&#xD;
        the target system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Zones - an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular&#xD;
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic&#xD;
        between two model elements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect&#xD;
        of the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology independent and product neutral&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Physical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of&#xD;
        the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology and product dependent&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the&#xD;
    level has been sized:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Unsized&lt;/strong> (or unranged) - the technology and products are specified to support the components&#xD;
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Ranged&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for&#xD;
        a defined range of circumstances.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Sized&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and&#xD;
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Levels of this artifact&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best&#xD;
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take&#xD;
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle&#xD;
    and the development techniques used.&amp;nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>logical&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>physical&lt;/strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,&#xD;
    iterative, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed&#xD;
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project &quot;milestone&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Varying depth of detail&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing&#xD;
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed&#xD;
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may include the same &quot;recurring pattern&quot; of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate&#xD;
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Cross-cutting viewpoints&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact and the logical and physical levels of this artifact may be the focus of a particular viewpoint, at any&#xD;
    degree of elaboration and refinement, to address the concerns of a particular stakeholder. These cross-cutting&#xD;
    viewpoints overlap with one another.&amp;nbsp; For example, views may be constructed on this artifact for the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Performance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Capacity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Availability and Recovery&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Security and Privacy Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operability and Operations Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software Distribution and Installation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Distributed Data Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Problem Identification and Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        End User Support/Helpdesk&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Networking&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Accessibility&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        National Language Support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Financial proprietary&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Archiving&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Such filtering does not generally change the elements in the artifact rather it simply enables a clearer focus on some&#xD;
    particular part of it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    details on the views and viewpoints framework including the relationship between base and cross-cutting views.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Linkages to other work products&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well as a linkage via Deployment Units with the functional aspect of architecture as embodied in the Component&#xD;
    Model, this artifact has influences and/or is strongly interdependent on other areas that cover the design of the&#xD;
    infrastructure that will implement the operational aspect of architecture. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Network Design: affects the application design, middleware selection, component placement, security and privacy,&#xD;
        systems management and overall operational system control.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Platform Design; the detailed design and configuration of the platforms that will implement the nodes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Storage Design; the detailed design and configuration of storage which may be shared across multiple platforms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Site &amp;amp; Facilities Design; the detailed design and configuration of the site and facilities in the locations in&#xD;
        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what&#xD;
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&amp;nbsp; Selection of a systems management style&#xD;
        is an important decision, which determines: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of operations management&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of software distribution&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The complexity of system management tooling&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Potential security and performance of the IT system (ability to satisfy the service level requirements)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Existing or planned enterprise-wide IT infrastructure initiatives on which the target system will be&#xD;
        implemented.&amp;nbsp; For example, enterprise wide middleware decisions may well move function, which would otherwise&#xD;
        be duplicated across multiple applications, into a set of shared services, which are usually purchased or part of&#xD;
        an enterprise wide development effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact provides:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A definition of the operational aspect of the architecture of a particular IT system, designed to meet a specific&#xD;
        set of functional and non-functional&amp;nbsp; requirements. The &quot;operational&quot; aspect focuses on the IT system&#xD;
        infrastructure.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A definition of a pattern of how the operational aspect of the architecture of an IT system (or parts of it) may be&#xD;
        constructed in order to satisfy a generalized set of functional and non-functional requirements. Examples may be&#xD;
        found in IBM's architectural assets or in an enterprise's architecture framework.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    For a particular IT system&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact may be used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As an input to architecture and design reviews, including confirmation that the business problem is well&#xD;
        articulated and that there is a viable IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As a way of dividing large problems so that each part can be worked on in relative isolation.&amp;nbsp; (For example, a&#xD;
        Manufacturing system may be seen as composed of a Customer Information System, a Scheduling System and a&#xD;
        Dispatching System. The operational aspect of each of these separate systems may then each be worked on&#xD;
        separately).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To enable application developers to modify and elaborate their work, based on this artifacts view of how the&#xD;
        application will be distributed and managed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To enable the analysis of how the IT system will deliver key non-functional requirements such as performance &amp;amp;&#xD;
        capacity, and security (confidentiality, integrity and availability), including the verification that the&#xD;
        non-functional requirements of the nodes and connections are achievable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To contribute to estimates of the cost of the system's operational infrastructure, both for budgeting and as part&#xD;
        of the business case for the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In conjunction with the functional aspect of the system, to help identify hardware and software technologies and&#xD;
        products, and to generally be a blueprint for the acquisition, installation, and subsequent maintenance of the&#xD;
        system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As a detailed technical specification against which an architect can evaluate alternative products or technology&#xD;
        vendors can submit tenders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    As a Pattern&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a pattern, this artifact may be used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To provide a &quot;quick start&quot; to projects, which can select, customize and integrate pre-developed, partial levels and&#xD;
        views of this artifact as a &quot;Reference Architecture&quot;.&amp;nbsp; This can save time, reduce required project resources&#xD;
        and reduce risk&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To control and constrain the options available to multiple and otherwise independent projects within an enterprise,&#xD;
        in order to standardize, realize economies of scale, reduce costs and achieve higher levels of flexibility and&#xD;
        interoperability across IT systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is the main description of an IT system's operational architecture. Without it, it becomes extremely&#xD;
    difficult to design and develop an IT system of any complexity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most obvious consequences will be that some functional requirements will be compromised and some non-functional&#xD;
    requirements will not be met. Without this artifact, this is unlikely to be identified until very late in the project&#xD;
    and either result in unexpected re-work which will impact the delivery schedule, or the system will fail to meet the&#xD;
    desired service level characteristics, and will be more prone to system failures when put into operation.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This artifact may be unnecessary if the IT system is very trivial, for example, a standalone PC application for a single&#xD;
computer.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact may contain the following which may be described by this artifact or by its contained artifacts, as&#xD;
    appropriate to the context:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An introduction, describing the overall context and content of the artifact, the nature of the artifact (either to&#xD;
        meet a specific set of IT requirement or to provide a generalized architecture pattern), its scope and depth of&#xD;
        detail, its level, and its degree of completeness.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the locations, borders, zones, and boundaries that provide the backdrop for the IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A model showing the placement of users of the IT system across locations and zones.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the deployment units and the connectors used for communication.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A model showing the relationship between deployment units, and the interactions between deployment units over&#xD;
        connectors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A model showing the relationship between nodes and connections, the distribution of nodes across locations and&#xD;
        zones, the interactions of nodes across connections, and the use of borders by connections.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the nodes (and/or collections of nodes) and connections between nodes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the placement of deployment units (and/or components) onto nodes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of how the operational aspect of the architecture of the IT system will support the functional and&#xD;
        non-functional requirements.&amp;nbsp; This includes considerations of how the various service levels (of performance,&#xD;
        availability and security) will be achieved, as well as defining the system's functional behaviour when operating&#xD;
        in an acceptable degraded mode caused by planned or unplanned system outages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the systems management approach to ensure the IT system maintains the target service levels.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        This will cover topics such as a backup and recovery, data and software distribution, change control, configuration&#xD;
        management, and other systems management processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Walkthrough diagram(s) showing how the elements in this artifact interact in order to support an activity triggered&#xD;
        by a user of the system. This would show how the &lt;em>deployment units&lt;/em> placed on &lt;em>nodes&lt;/em> co-operate in&#xD;
        support of selected &lt;em>use cases&lt;/em> for particular &lt;em>actors&lt;/em> in particular &lt;em>locations&lt;/em> and/or&#xD;
