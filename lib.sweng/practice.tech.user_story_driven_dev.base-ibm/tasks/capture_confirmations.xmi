  <mainDescription>&lt;p> During the conversations with stakeholders, the team identifies and captures &#xD;
  what makes each user story complete, such as these examples: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Unexpected behaviors&lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Exceptions and error conditions &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Different types of users that might exist&lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Data that needs to be in place&lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>These conditions, also called&lt;em> story&amp;nbsp;confirmations&lt;/em>, help the team&amp;nbsp;create &#xD;
  test cases to be&amp;nbsp;conducted so that they can later evaluate whether the &#xD;
  user story is complete and accepted by stakeholders. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Detailing user stories does not&amp;nbsp;imply that all&amp;nbsp;user stories&amp;nbsp;will &#xD;
  be detailed before commencing implementation on them. The level of detail captured &#xD;
  will vary, depending upon the needs of the project and the complexity of the &#xD;
  user story.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Nonfunctional requirements (such as expected performance, availability, adherence &#xD;
  to standards), as well as business rules&amp;nbsp;that apply to a specific user &#xD;
  story,&amp;nbsp;are also&amp;nbsp;captured as story confirmations for that user story. &#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss with stakeholders what information is needed by the user story. If information&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;exchanged&#xD;
    between the user and the system, be specific about what is passed back and forth, and capture it on the user story&#xD;
    card.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure that you define newly discovered domain terms or ambiguous terms properly in&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;glossary. If your understanding of the domain has improved, refine existing glossary terms.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_M8OhcE7wEd6jv7uk8SIgdg" name="Identify and capture system-wide requirements" guid="_M8OhcE7wEd6jv7uk8SIgdg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    System-wide requirements&amp;nbsp;specify constraints on the solution, such as usability, reliability, performance,&#xD;
    supportability, interfaces with legacy systems and so forth. Depending upon the domain, there may be regulatory&#xD;
    requirements that apply, too.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and capture&amp;nbsp;the relevant system-wide requirements for each user story&#xD;
    and across many user stories.&amp;nbsp;This helps&amp;nbsp;the team and stakeholders&amp;nbsp;assess the completeness of your user&#xD;
    stories. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Identify and capture those conditions that - if satisfied - guarantee that the user story has been successfully&#xD;

and so that there is a clear definition of the completeness of each user story.</purpose>
