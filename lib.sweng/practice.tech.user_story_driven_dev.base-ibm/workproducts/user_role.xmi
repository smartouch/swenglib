  <mainDescription>&lt;p> A user role&amp;nbsp;represents users of the system under development who have &#xD;
  similar attributes. These are some of the common attributes that differentiate &#xD;
  user roles from each other: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Frequency of using the software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Proficiency with using computers and similar systems&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Domain knowledge&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Reasons for using the system or problems that they want to solve&lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> Identifying user roles&amp;nbsp;helps the team and stakeholders gain insight on &#xD;
  who will use the system, what their objectives are,&amp;nbsp;what problems they &#xD;
  have that the system will be solving, and so on. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To help the team and stakeholders identify who will use the system as part of &#xD;
capturing valuable user stories.</purpose>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p> For&amp;nbsp;informal projects, or when there is not a large number of user roles &#xD;
  and personas involved, or when there is no need to capture a separate list of &#xD;
  user roles and personas for communication purposes, use index cards&amp;nbsp;to &#xD;
  capture the name and description of each&amp;nbsp;user role, as well as each persona &#xD;
  and its description.&amp;nbsp;User role names are also&amp;nbsp;captured on each user &#xD;
  story card&amp;nbsp;as part of the user story statement &quot;As a [user role] ....&quot;&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> For larger, more complex projects where there is a large number of user roles &#xD;
  or personas, or where there is a need to communicate the user roles and personas &#xD;
  descriptions, synonyms, and so on outside of the team, consider capturing user &#xD;
  roles and personas in a separate text document, spreadsheet, or database, including &#xD;
  as many&amp;nbsp;attributes as appropriate to capture all information that you need &#xD;
  for your project. &lt;/p></representationOptions>
