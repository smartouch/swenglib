  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user story is a brief description of a system requirement from a user's perspective. It can be defined at a high&#xD;
    level and decomposed as needed into smaller stories. User stories need to be independent of each other and right-sized&#xD;
    to allow them to be prioritized, estimated, and taken on&amp;nbsp;by team members to be&amp;nbsp;developed in a&amp;nbsp;short&#xD;
    time. Throughout the development lifecycle, user stories are allowed to be big, then broken down and detailed for&#xD;
    estimation and development, but also&amp;nbsp;grouped together for prioritization in the longer time frame.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the following sections, we introduce epics and themes as ways to represent and&amp;nbsp;group user stories. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkwithUsertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/tech_references_17D34A60.html#COH04&quot; guid=&quot;_OKj94D8iEd2AxfTL63EayA&quot;>[COH04]&lt;/a> for additional information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Epics&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Epics are single, large&amp;nbsp;stories that&amp;nbsp;usually represent complex requirements not ready to be partitioned yet,&#xD;
    either because they are of low priority and will be partitioned later in the development lifecycle, or because there&#xD;
    hasn't been a conversation between stakeholders and the development team to better understand those stories. It is&#xD;
    common that, early in the lifecycle, there are many epics, encompassing high-level product features requested by&#xD;
    stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;As the conversation evolves, many smaller stories&amp;nbsp;originate from those epics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following is an example of an epic:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As a bank customer, I want to use an ATM to perform my banking activities.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is epic in scope, because the development required seems to be as big as&amp;nbsp;a complete&amp;nbsp;ATM system. This&#xD;
    might represent the first request that the stakeholder ever made to the team. It is too complex to be estimated&#xD;
    and&amp;nbsp;too big to be finished in an iteration or cycle. It corresponds to the work of a whole team through various&#xD;
    iterations or cycles to complete an entire product release. In short,&amp;nbsp;this large story&amp;nbsp;does not&#xD;
    possess&amp;nbsp;some of the&amp;nbsp;characteristics of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.user_story_driven_dev.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/invest_model_2D82989.html&quot; guid=&quot;_K8khID55Ed6FxpOwnkUDmw&quot;>INVEST Model&lt;/a> (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The epic in this example could be broken down into stories such as these examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As a bank customer, I want to use an ATM&amp;nbsp;to pay my bills.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As a bank customer, I want to use an ATM so I can withdraw cash.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, those two stories still seem to be epics, because they are still complex to estimate and too big to finish in&#xD;
    a short time frame. Ideally, they should be further broken down into more granular user stories. Let's take, for&#xD;
    example, the epic related to paying bills, and break it down:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As an&amp;nbsp;ATM user, I want to use my debit card to pay my electricity bill.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As an ATM user, I want to schedule recurring automatic payments for my cable company bill.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
        As an ATM user, I want to use my&amp;nbsp;debit card to pay my VISA credit card bill.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Notice that by defining a more specific user role (ATM user&amp;nbsp;rather than&amp;nbsp;bank customer) and providing&#xD;
    different usage scenarios (different bill types, specific vendors or providers), it is possible to&amp;nbsp;write more&#xD;
    granular user stories that are in&amp;nbsp;better shape to be discussed with stakeholders, prioritized, estimated, and&#xD;
    developed in a short time frame.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Themes&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process of breaking down larger stories into smaller ones helps the team and stakeholders better discuss their&#xD;
    details, prioritize them, and have the team estimate and develop those stories in a short time box, such as an&#xD;
    iteration. However, for the purposes of prioritizing stories along a longer time span, such as a release time frame&#xD;
    (many weeks to a few months), the prioritization of many fine-grained stories is a difficult process. Therefore, it may&#xD;
    make the stories easier for stakeholders to follow if you group shorter ones into collections, perhaps according to&#xD;
    those that will have more business value if they are developed simultaneously. It may help the development team to also&#xD;
    define what stories go well together, such as stories that have common infrastructure needs or address a common set of&#xD;
    features.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These collections of user stories are referred to as &lt;em>themes&lt;/em>. A simple analogy is to think of a pack of index&#xD;
    cards that represent stories, all bundled together by a rubber band. This provides the flexibility needed for&#xD;
    stakeholders and the team to decide to add or remove stories from the pack as appropriate for prioritization and&#xD;
    development purposes. A given theme can also be split in more sub-themes as needed, with the option of sub-themes being&#xD;
    of higher priority than others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the previous ATM&amp;nbsp;application example, these are examples of major themes to use to group stories together:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Bill Payment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cash Withdrawal&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Money Transfer&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the purposes of prioritization along a release time frame, that grouping should be enough. However, for the&#xD;
    purposes of more refined prioritization, stakeholders and teams may decide to break a theme down into smaller&#xD;
    sub-themes. For example,&amp;nbsp;the Bill Payment theme can be broken down into the following sub-themes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Bill Payment with Debit Card&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Bill Payment with Scheduled&amp;nbsp;Payments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
