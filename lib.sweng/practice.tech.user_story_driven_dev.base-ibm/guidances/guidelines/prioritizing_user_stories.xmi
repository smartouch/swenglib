    Prioritizing stories&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The prioritization of user stories and technical stories is driven by the stakeholders and facilitated by the&#xD;
    development team. These two groups collaborate to prioritize the stories for a given release according to the&#xD;
    stakeholders' business needs and the team's understanding of the highest architectural risks to be addressed.&amp;nbsp;This&#xD;
    prioritization allows the following to happen:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Both the stakeholders and the development team identify the critical functionality that the stakeholders need.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The development team highlights the essential stories that must be met if the team is to produce an application&#xD;
        that will be useful to the stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a situation arises in which it appears likely that deadlines and effort estimates will constrain the development&#xD;
    team's ability to deliver all known functionality, the stakeholders' prioritization of stories facilitates subsequent&#xD;
    scope reduction.&amp;nbsp;In such a situation, the stakeholders and the development team can work together to further&#xD;
    negotiate and reprioritize remaining stories so that something of benefit can be produced by the deadline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scope prioritization is a powerful tool for businesses that need to react to, for instance,&amp;nbsp;changing market&#xD;
    conditions and new opportunities.&amp;nbsp;As such, scope prioritization should recur several times during a release. Scope&#xD;
    prioritization and scope reduction must continue to occur until the stakeholders and the development team have agreed&#xD;
    on a baseline commitment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given that development time boxes (such as releases and iterations) are fixed, the deliverables from a time box may end&#xD;
    up being less than was originally planned. If this is the case, it is important that all essential work is done within&#xD;
    the time box and that only less-critical work is omitted. The method of ensuring that this is true is scope&#xD;
    prioritization, which means prioritization of the stories to help with scope reduction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Limiting functionality to meet an iteration deadline does not mean limiting quality.&amp;nbsp;As with any software&#xD;
    development endeavor, the development team strives to deliver an application fit for the business purpose: defect-free,&#xD;
    user-friendly, and so on.&amp;nbsp;The objective at the end of a development increment is to deliver a set of stories that&#xD;
    will do useful work when the application is deployed into production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    The MoSCoW rules&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The simple rules known as MoSCoW rules can be used to achieve clear prioritization of requirements. The development&#xD;
    team can use these rules to lead the stakeholders and to formalize the way in which the they prioritize the stories for&#xD;
    the system under development.&amp;nbsp;The following table explains what the words in MoSCoW mean.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;table title=&quot;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; summary=&quot;MoSCoW rules&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;tbody>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>M&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;>&#xD;
                Must have&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;76%&quot;>&#xD;
                Essential stories that are fundamental to the system.&amp;nbsp;Without them, the system will be unworkable and&#xD;
                useless. The &quot;must haves&quot; define the &lt;strong>minimum&lt;/strong> usable subset.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;p>&#xD;
                    Should have&#xD;
                &lt;/p>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Important stories for which there is a workaround in the short term. These stories would normally&#xD;
                be&amp;nbsp;categorized as mandatory in a less time-constrained project, but the system will be useful and&#xD;
                usable without them.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>C&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Could have&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Stories that can more easily be left out of the increment under development.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>W&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Want to have but won't have this time&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Valuable stories for which there is an appropriate alternative or a manual workaround. These stories can&#xD;
                and will wait until later development.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Applying the MoSCoW rules&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The MoSCoW rules provide the basis for decisions about what the project team will do during the overall time box (such&#xD;
    as for a release), as well as within each nested time box (such as iterations). As new stories arise or as existing&#xD;
    ones are defined in more detail, use the MoSCoW rules to decide how critical the stories are to the success of the&#xD;
    current work. Review all priorities regularly throughout the project to ensure that they are still valid.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is essential that not everything to be achieved within a time box is categorized as &quot;must have.&quot;&amp;nbsp;It is the&#xD;
    lower-priority stories that enable the team to deliver on time, because they can drop those stories out of the current&#xD;
    iteration if and when problems arise. It is possible that you may face a situation in which the following happens:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You have dropped all possible lower-priority stories so that all of the remaining ones are categorized as&#xD;
        must-haves,&lt;strong>and&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Your assessment is that you will not be able to meet the deadline for all of those remaining stories.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To address this situation, you need to work with the stakeholders to do the following things:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If possible, reprioritize the remaining stories (according to the MoSCoW rules).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Re-negotiate reduced scope for this time box with the stakeholders, and adjust the remaining time boxes&#xD;
        accordingly, moving some of the original must-haves to later time boxes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If re-planning does not result in a viable plan, the project might no longer be viable as it stands and, in extreme&#xD;
        cases, might have to be reconsidered by the stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This mitigation strategy is designed to ensure that the stakeholders receive a usable application at the release&#xD;
    deadline.&#xD;
