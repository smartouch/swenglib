  <mainDescription>&lt;p> When developing a new system, it is important to understand who the system &#xD;
  is being built for. If we know who the key stakeholders and sponsors are,we &#xD;
  understand their objectives for bringing the system to life. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> But more importantly,we need to identify those who will use the system. Invariably, &#xD;
  the system under development will be used by more than one user, and users probably &#xD;
  have different reasons for using the system. We need to identify who the various &#xD;
  users are so that you can identify stories that are relevant to those users. &#xD;
  This process increases the likelihood of making the system more tangible to &#xD;
  users, because you start thinking about how to solve the needs of real people. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The next sections describe common steps performed in sessions to model user &#xD;
  roles. These sessions should be conducted with stakeholders as needed to help &#xD;
  the team and stakeholders identify, group, refine, and capture user roles and &#xD;
  personas. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Identifying user roles &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> A user role represents a &lt;em>population of users&lt;/em> that share similar attributes &#xD;
  and interaction with the system.Each user role has different characteristics &#xD;
  or attributes that help identify different ways that each interacts with system. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Brainstorm with stakeholders and identify the different user roles for the &#xD;
  system. Try to identify as many as possible, based on user role characteristics, &#xD;
  such as their backgrounds, their objectives for using the system, their levels &#xD;
  of experience with using software in general or using similar systems, and so &#xD;
  on. Don't criticize suggestions nor be concerned about consolidating user roles &#xD;
  at this stage. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> For an ATM system, the following are examples of user roles: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> ATM User withdraws the full balance of his bank account in cash once a &#xD;
    month &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> ATM User withdraws cash every week and pays or schedules payment of bills &#xD;
    through the ATM system &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> ATM operator runs operational reports and maintains the ATM functions &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Grouping user roles &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Look at common attributes of user roles so that you can group those who have &#xD;
  similar characteristics. Typical attributes to look for when grouping user roles &#xD;
  are how frequently they will use the system, how proficient they are with computers &#xD;
  and software in general, how much they know about the business domain, and so &#xD;
  on. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The previous list of user roles might indicate there are two types of user &#xD;
  roles: ATM Users and ATM operators. A careful look at the ATM Users, though, &#xD;
  indicates that some use the ATM system for one common operation only (withdrawing &#xD;
  cash) and only once in a while; whereas, other users use more of the ATM functions &#xD;
  more often. This results in at least three possible user roles: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Infrequent ATM User &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Advanced ATM User &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> ATM operator &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Capturing user roles &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> As part of the identification and grouping of user roles, use an interactive &#xD;
  and practical way to capture a list of roles that can be easily changed to accommodate &#xD;
  the grouping. This can be done in any electronic format, such as word processor, &#xD;
  spreadsheet, or any collaboration tool, as well as in simple ways, such as using &#xD;
  index cards that can be tossed around and grouped. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> After grouping user roles by type, write a short description for each user &#xD;
  role,perhaps on an index card, such as this example:&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;> User role: Advanced ATM User  &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;> Likes to pay bills before due date to avoid fees and penalties. &#xD;
    Pays or schedules bills to be paid electronically. Withdraws cash once or &#xD;
    twice a week to pay daily expenses. Values the availability of ATM systems &#xD;
    near work and home more than richness of user interface or speed of transactions. &#xD;
  &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Capturing personas &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> A &lt;em>persona&lt;/em>, as the term implies, is a personification or imaginary &#xD;
  representation of a user role.As you go through the identification and grouping &#xD;
  of user roles with stakeholders, it can be helpful to identify and capture one &#xD;
  or two personas per user role, because this helps to identify which goals typical &#xD;
  users have for using the system and how they will interact with the system. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> This is an example of persona for the Advanced ATM User role: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;> Jill is an independent HR professional who is currently providing &#xD;
    services for the XYZ company. As part of her job, she usually spends three &#xD;
    to five days week visiting different offices across the state. Because she &#xD;
    is out of town most of the time, Jill likes to pay her utility bills in advance &#xD;
    so that she will avoid late-payment fees, interest, and penalties. She does &#xD;
    not use credit cards, because she is trying to pay off her debts. Jill does &#xD;
    not have a computer or easy access to Internet banking services currently, &#xD;
    so she cannot schedule payments or pay her utility bills online. She prefers &#xD;
    to do handle her bill payments by using ATM systems, instead. Jill does not &#xD;
    like to drive in the cities where the offices are located, so she usually &#xD;
    catches a train or cab and pays in cash. She also prefers to pay other daily &#xD;
    expenses in cash, such as coffee and dinner, which are not included in her &#xD;
    &lt;em>per diem &lt;/em>expenses rate. For Jill, it is essential to have ATMs conveniently &#xD;
    located to pay bills and withdraw cash regularly. &lt;/p>&#xD;
