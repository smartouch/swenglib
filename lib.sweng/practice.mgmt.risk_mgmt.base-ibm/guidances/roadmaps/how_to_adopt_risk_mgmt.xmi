    Getting Started&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To get started with adopting this practice, identify if your organization already has a defined risk management process&#xD;
    that your project could follow, and decide on whether to follow the organization process (as is) or to adapt the&#xD;
    process to your project needs. You may want to use - or refine to your project needs - risk management related areas&#xD;
    such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Approach to identify, analyze and prioritize risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List of&amp;nbsp;potential sources of risk and&amp;nbsp;typical risk categories, as well as impacted stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        to&amp;nbsp;monitor&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span> each significant risk and its mitigation activities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Groups or individuals involved in the project's risk management activities for your project, and their&#xD;
        responsibilities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Budget available in your project for managing project risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tools and techniques that will be used in your project to store risk information, evaluate risks, track the status&#xD;
        of risks or generate risk management reports&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can accelerate&amp;nbsp;the risk identification process for your project if you start with a list of known and expected&#xD;
    types of risks for projects in your organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Create a list of prioritized risks (ranked by risk exposure) and come up with strategies to address the &quot;top 10&quot; or so&#xD;
    risks only. It may not be worth, from a financial perspective, to come up with strategies for all the identified risks&#xD;
    (for some risks, the best strategy may even be acceptance).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Everyone in the team&amp;nbsp;is responsible for risk management, in other words, the team and stakeholders collaborate&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;identify, asses, and propose strategies to deal with risks. Not everyone&amp;nbsp;will necessarily be responsible&#xD;
    for implementing&amp;nbsp;strategies to address one or more risks or become&amp;nbsp;a &quot;risk owner&quot;,&amp;nbsp;although it is&#xD;
    expected that at some point in the project&amp;nbsp;lifecycle a team member&amp;nbsp;could be&amp;nbsp;requested - or volunteer -&#xD;
    to take ownership of risks actions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evaluate and assess risks periodically. Recognize that changes will happen throughout the project and that risks need&#xD;
    to be identified and assessed on a regular basis, minimally at each iteration of phase of your project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common Pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Not involving relevant stakeholders in risk identification&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The whole team and stakeholders need to participate in the risk identification activity. If you involve only one group&#xD;
    in risk identification,&amp;nbsp;for example only&amp;nbsp;the project team, you may end up not capturing risks that are&#xD;
    relevant to other groups, such as business and marketing risks, etc. If you identify risks with external stakeholders&#xD;
    and do not include the team in risk identification, you may miss important risks related to technology and scope, to&#xD;
    name a few types.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identifying risks only at the beginning of the project&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common pitfall that leads to poor risk management is to think that risks need to be identified only at the beginning&#xD;
    of the project without the need to revisit the risk list often. New risks do appear throughout the project, and&#xD;
    previously identified risks may never happen (those with low likelihood of happening), so it is essential to revisit&#xD;
    risks throughout the project at intervals when the team and stakeholders meet to identify new risks and assess if&#xD;
    identified risk actions are being effective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
