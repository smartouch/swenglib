    When no more risks are being found, look at the risk list as a group to see if there are any natural groupings&#xD;
    (occurrences of the same risk), and combine risks where possible in order to eliminate duplicates. Sometimes, the risks&#xD;
    identified will be symptoms of some more fundamental risk; in this case, group the related risks together under the&#xD;
    more fundamental risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quantitative risk management techniques recommend that risks be prioritized according to the overall risk exposure the&#xD;
    risk represents to the project. To determine the exposure for each risk the group should estimate the following&#xD;
    information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Impact of risk&lt;/strong>: The deviations of schedule, effort, or costs from plan if the risk occurs&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Likelihood of occurrence&lt;/strong>: The probability that the risk will actually occur (usually expressed as&#xD;
        a percentage)&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Risk exposure&lt;/strong>: Calculated by multiplying the impact by the likelihood of occurrence&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a group, the exposure of each risk should be derived by consensus. Significant differences of opinion should be&#xD;
    further discussed to see if everyone is interpreting the risk the same way. Typically this information is included as&#xD;
    columns in a tabular Risk List.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is human nature to worry about the highest impact risks, but if these are very unlikely to occur they are really&#xD;
    less important than more moderate risks that are often overlooked. By considering both the magnitude of the risk and&#xD;
    its likelihood of occurrence, this approach helps project managers focus their risk management efforts in areas that&#xD;
    will have the most significant affect on project delivery.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the exposure for each risk has been determined, you can sort the risks in order of decreasing exposure to create&#xD;
    your &quot;top 10&quot; Risks List.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because estimation of likelihood and cost is expensive and risky in itself, it is generally only useful to gauge the&#xD;
    impact of the top 10 to 20 risks. Smaller projects may consider fewer risks, whereas larger projects present a larger&#xD;
    'risk target' and as a result have a larger number of relevant risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to ranking the risks in descending order of exposure, you may also find it useful to group or cluster the&#xD;
    risks into categories, based on the magnitude of their impact on the project (risk magnitude). In most cases,&#xD;
    having&amp;nbsp;five categories is sufficient:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        High&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Significant&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Moderate&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Minor&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Low&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the risks and circulate them among the project team members.&#xD;
