  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make an inventory of the potential risks to the project. Gather the project team together in early phases or iterations&#xD;
    of the project in order to&amp;nbsp;create an initial risk&amp;nbsp;list.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When&amp;nbsp;you identify risks, consider 'what can go wrong'. At the broadest level, of course, everything can go wrong.&#xD;
    The point is not to cast a pessimistic view on the project, however; identify potential barriers to success so&#xD;
    that&amp;nbsp;you can reduce or eliminate them.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    More specifically, look for the events which might occur which would decrease the likelihood that&amp;nbsp;you deliver the&#xD;
    project with the right features, the required level of quality, on time and within budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using brainstorming techniques, ask each member to identify a project risk. Clarification questions are allowed, but&#xD;
    the risks should not be evaluated or commented on by the group. Go around the table until no more risks can be&#xD;
    identified. It might be useful for the team identify the potential risk sources, risk categories,&amp;nbsp;and impacted&#xD;
    stakeholders - this could help the team identify potential new risks.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Involve all parties in this process, and don't worry too much about form or duplicates; you can clean up the list&#xD;
    later. Use homogeneous groups of people (customers, users, technical people, and so on). This eases the process of&#xD;
    collecting risks -&amp;nbsp;individuals are less inhibited in front of their peers (in specialty and hierarchy) than in a&#xD;
    large mix.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make clear to the participants that raising a risk does not equate in any way with volunteering to address the risk. If&#xD;
    there is any sense that raising a risk will result in becoming responsible for addressing it, no one will identify any&#xD;
    risks (or the risks they do raise will be trivial).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start with a generic risk lists such as the &lt;b>Assessment and Control of Software Risks&lt;/b> by Capers Jones [&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/reference_mgmt.add_rup_D5C634A1.html#JON94&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;__TlZAB2ZEd--YPaIW7QkIg&quot;>JON94&lt;/a>] or the &lt;strong>Taxonomy-Based Risk Identification&lt;/strong> established by the&#xD;
    Software Engineering Institute [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/reference_mgmt.add_rup_D5C634A1.html#JON94&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;__TlZAB2ZEd--YPaIW7QkIg&quot;>CAR93&lt;/a>]. Circulate the risk list: seeing what has been already identified often helps&#xD;
    people to identify more.&#xD;
