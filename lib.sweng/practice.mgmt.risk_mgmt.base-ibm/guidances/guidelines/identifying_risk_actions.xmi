    Risk mitigation&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For direct risks, that is,&amp;nbsp;risks for which the project has some degree of control, identify what actions will be&#xD;
    taken to reduce the probability of the risk, or to reduce&amp;nbsp;the risk&amp;nbsp;impact on the project (the mitigation&#xD;
    strategies). Typically, the risk itself derives from lack of information; often, the mitigation strategy itself is one&#xD;
    of investigating the topic further to reduce the uncertainty.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: before implementing risk mitigation strategies as described below, determine the cost-benefit&amp;nbsp;ratio of&#xD;
    implementing each strategy. If it is more expensive to implement a mitigation strategy than the actual consequence cost&#xD;
    of a risk materializing, you&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;decide to accept the risk instead of pursuing action to mitigate it.&#xD;
    However, be sure to take into consideration that cost and benefit do not always translate to monetary value only -&#xD;
    there may be other aspects of benefit and cost such as company reputation, market share, etc., that should be&#xD;
    considered in the cost-benefit evaluation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take action to&amp;nbsp;either make the risk materialize or retire. Allocate such actions to early phases or iterations of&#xD;
    the project lifecycle to mitigate the risk as early as possible. Confront the risks as early as possible. If a risk is&#xD;
    in the form &quot;X may not function as planned?&quot;, then plan to try X as soon as possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the levels and thresholds that define when a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers the execution of a risk&#xD;
    mitigation plan or a contingency plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are examples of risk mitigation strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that products X and Y cannot be integrated, a prototype will be built to investigate the&#xD;
        difficulty of integration. The following features (enumerated in a list) will be tested to ensure the integration&#xD;
        is successful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that database A will not perform adequately, it will be benchmarked using a suite of tests which&#xD;
        model the workload of the target application.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that the test tool Z will not be able to effectively perform regression test of the application,&#xD;
        we will acquire and use it during the upcoming iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of these actions should be to reduce the probability that certain risks will occur, perhaps to near zero. In&#xD;
    cases where the risk is confirmed, the risk is responded to with a contingency plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Risk contingency&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each risk, whether you have a plan to actively mitigate it or not, you must decide what actions are to be taken&#xD;
    when or if the risk materializes, that is, if it becomes a problem -&amp;nbsp;a 'loss event' in insurance jargon. This is&#xD;
    commonly called &quot;a plan B&quot; or contingency plan. A contingency plan is needed when risk avoidance and risk transfer have&#xD;
    failed, when mitigation was not successful, and now the risk must be addressed head-on. This is very often the case for&#xD;
    indirect risks, that is, the risks for which the project has no control, or when the mitigation strategies are too&#xD;
    costly to implement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The contingency plan should&amp;nbsp;answer the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Risk&lt;/strong>: What is the risk?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Indicator&lt;/strong>: How will you know that the risk has become a reality? How is the 'loss event'&#xD;
        recognized?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Action&lt;/strong>: What should be done to address the 'loss event' (how can you stop the &quot;bleeding&quot;?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identify Risk Indicators&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks can be monitored using project metrics or looking at trends and threshold; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rework remaining&amp;nbsp;too high&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Breakage remaining&amp;nbsp;too high&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actual expenditure&amp;nbsp;far above plans&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks can be monitored based on project requirements and test results; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Response times one order of magnitude above requirement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks are associated to a specific event; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software component not delivered in time by third party.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many other, &quot;softer&quot; indicators, none of which will fully diagnose the problem. For example, there is always&#xD;
    a risk that morale will drop (in fact, at certain points in the project, this is almost predictable). There are a&#xD;
    number of other indicators: grumbling, &quot;gallows humor&quot;, missed deadlines, poor quality, and so on. No one of these&#xD;
    &quot;measures&quot; is a sure indicator; joking about the futility of a particular deliverable can be a healthy way of relieving&#xD;
    stress, but if it continues, it may be an indication that the team feels an increasing sense of impending doom.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Listen to all indicators without passing judgment. It is easy to label the bearer of 'bad news' as someone who has a&#xD;
    bad attitude; behind cynicism there is often more than a grain of truth. Often, the 'bearer of bad news' is acting as&#xD;
    the 'conscience of the project'. Most people want the project to succeed, and they feel frustrated when momentum is&#xD;
    carrying the project in the other direction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identify &quot;Loss&quot; Actions, or &quot;Plan B&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For simple cases, the contingency plan enumerates alternate solutions. The impact is usually costs and delays to scrap&#xD;
    the current solution and implement the new one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For other, &quot;softer&quot; risks is often not one action to take when a loss has occurred, but several. When morale drops, for&#xD;
    example, it is best to acknowledge the condition and gather as a group to discuss the prevailing attitudes on the&#xD;
    project. Listen to concerns, identify issues, and generally let people vent. After an appropriate amount of venting,&#xD;
    though, move on to address the causes of concern. Use the risk list as a way to focus the discussion. Translate the&#xD;
    concerns into a concrete action plan by reprioritizing risks and then reformulating the iteration plans to&#xD;
    systematically address the top risks. Positive action has a stronger effect than positive (but empty) words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Despite the mood at the time, a loss occurrence has a positive side: it forces action. Too often it is easy to postpone&#xD;
    risks by ignoring them, lulled into complacency by the apparent quiet. When a loss event occurs, action is required.&#xD;
    The risk is no longer a risk, there is no longer any uncertainty about its occurrence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Yet a loss occurrence is also a failure to avoid or mitigate risk. It should force a re-examination of the risk list to&#xD;
    determine whether the project team may have some systematic blind-spots. As difficult as frank self-assessment is, it&#xD;
    may prevent other problems later on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Risk avoidance&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While not always possible, sometimes you can side-step risks altogether. Often risk is caused by poor system scope; if&#xD;
    you can reduce the scope of the system (by eliminating non-essential requirements), whole sections of the risk&#xD;
    list&amp;nbsp;are removed&amp;nbsp;with the dropped requirements. An equally important risk is not having enough resources&#xD;
    (including time) to do the work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In other cases, technology can be acquired to reduce the risk of building particular functionality, a form of risk&#xD;
    avoidance in which one set of risks (that of building the technology) is exchanged for another (that of being dependent&#xD;
    upon forces outside one's control).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally risks can be transferred to other organizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
