    IT solutions are conduits to sensitive corporate and customer information.&amp;nbsp; Here, the security architect&#xD;
    identifies likely threats and documents requirements for mitigating the threats.&amp;nbsp; He identifies high-level&#xD;
    security patterns appropriate to attach to architectural elements in response to security requirements and policies.&#xD;
    These patterns are then refined with detailed patterns appropriate to particular technology and platform choices by&#xD;
    down-stream design and implementation tasks.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capture&amp;nbsp;high-level security requirements in&amp;nbsp;the Software Architecture document&amp;nbsp;and in the system-wide&#xD;
    requirements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;security architect&amp;nbsp;elicits these complex requirements from the stakeholders in&#xD;
    the project, and captures them in easy to understand statements (intents). Document these in general, as well as for&#xD;
    specific elements of the service model and the component model that might be of particular focus.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reason for the emphasis on intent at this stage is that in many cases, when they are asked about security in a requirements&#xD;
    gathering session, most stakeholders will respond that &quot;&lt;em>of course, everything must be secure&lt;/em>&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Does that&#xD;
    mean that everything is encrypted, audited, and so on, to which the reply is &quot;&lt;em>oh yes, please&lt;/em>&quot;. At this point&#xD;
    the security architect explains the implications of such a decision, the cost, the complexity, and the group starts to&#xD;
    have a meaningful discussion about which patterns are relevant to which elements in the architecture. It is these&#xD;
    patterns that express the intent of the system with regard to security, whereas the design-level patterns express the&#xD;
    mechanisms for fulfilling the intent. Finally, implementation patterns express the technology used to fulfill the&#xD;
    intent.&#xD;
