  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Following systems engineering, a hand off from the system team to each of the subsystem will be created. It will be a&#xD;
    package - or possibly even a separate model -&amp;nbsp;that forms the model-based specification for the subsystem. This&#xD;
    task creates the subsystem model that will import that specification and provide a place for the subsystem team to&#xD;
    allocate the requirements into the various discipline, create the deployment architecture for the subsystem and for the&#xD;
    software engineers to put their software analysis and design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not expected that the non-software engineering disciplines will continue to work in UML/SysML models after the&#xD;
    requirements are allocated and the deployment architecture defined. Nevertheless, this model provides the specification&#xD;
    for those hardware engineering disciplines.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>Create a locally controlled copy of the engineering specifications handed off by systems engineering. The imported&#xD;
specification will require refinement - including allocation to engineering disciplines and creation of derived&#xD;
requirements - before it is ready to be used.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_76UREEEmEeCRBdp-xn1ltA" name="Establish Subsystem baseline" guid="_76UREEEmEeCRBdp-xn1ltA">
    <sectionDescription>The subsystem baseline includes the hand off information imported from system engineering, the deployment architecture of&#xD;
the subsystem the allocated requirements and specified interdisciplinary interfaces. This forms the starting point of what&#xD;
is commonly known as &quot;down-stream engineering&quot; or &quot;development engineering&quot; which includes design and development of&#xD;
electronic, mechanical and software aspects of a subsystem.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>The purpose is to create a model-based environment in which the subsystem engineerings - of all disciplines - can work.</purpose>
