  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Systems engineering generally defines what is known as the &quot;logical interface&quot; between the system and its actors and&#xD;
    among subsystems. The logical interfaces provides organizations of named services, (highly) abstract data types with&#xD;
    ranges and constraints, and various quality of service parameters. In this task, the engineering staff must refine&#xD;
    these logical interfaces in deployable physical interfaces. Requires the usage of services within defined APIs of&#xD;
    existing equipment or agreements between teams on devices not yet developed. The services must be qualified with actual&#xD;
    data schema (bit-mapped formats), and qualities of service.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every logical interface must be realized, but it may not be in a 1:1 way; it is common for a logical interface to&#xD;
    result in many physical messages or machine motions that constitute the actual physical interface. In addition, logical&#xD;
    interfaces should provide range and fidelity metadata on the parameters of the interface but not the physical data&#xD;
    schema; the physical data scheme must be defined within this task.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

The logical information should specify the extent of the parameter (i.e. acceptable values) but the schema must define the&#xD;
storage and transmission format, bit ordering, and so on.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Review and evaluate the resulting physical interfaces between the system and its actors and between the subsystems in terms&#xD;
