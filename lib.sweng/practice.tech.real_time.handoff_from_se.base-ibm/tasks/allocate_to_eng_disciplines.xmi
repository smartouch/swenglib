  <mainDescription>A subsystem team is usually comprised of engineers within different disciplines, such as software, digital electronics,&#xD;
analog electronics, hydraulic, pneumatic, control, and mechanical. Once the subsystem specification is handed off, certain&#xD;
of the requirements will belong to one discipline or the other. Other requirements will require decomposition into derived&#xD;
requirements, allocating portions of a subsystem-level requirement to different discipline. This is particularly true of&#xD;
quality-of service requirements.</mainDescription>
  <sections xmi:id="_5y6vEC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Review subsystem requirements" guid="_5y6vEC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>This step examines the subsystem specifications in all its forms - including SysML models, state and control&#xD;
specifications, requirements specifications, and logical and physical subsystem interfaces to make sure that the&#xD;
interdisciplinary team understands what is necessary. If requirements are missing, incomplete, inadequate, or&#xD;
incorrect,&amp;nbsp;clarification from the system engineering team or subject matter experts must be sought.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_8JasYC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Allocate single-discipline requirements" guid="_8JasYC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>Many of the requirements will be clearly related to a single discipline. These may be allocated directly.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="__uv0UC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Decompose multi-discipline requirements" guid="__uv0UC-0EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>Many subsystem requirements require the interaction of one or more engineering disciplines. Clarity as to which&#xD;
responsibility will be met by which discipline is required. This is best done with a collaboration of the engineering staff&#xD;
from all relevant disciplines - such as electronics and software - to arrive at an optimal solution. This results in&#xD;
derived requirements. Derived requirements must together met the original subsystem requirement.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_CVMSIC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Allocate derived requirements" guid="_CVMSIC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>Each derived requirement should be allocated to a single subsystem engineering discipline. If a derived requirement cannot&#xD;
be allocated to a single subsystem, then it must be further refined.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_DQ8vwC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Update traceability record" guid="_DQ8vwC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>Depending on the level of traceability required, the traceability record for the requirements should be updated to show&#xD;
which engineering discipline within the subsystem has responsibility for meeting the allocated requirements.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_FYjVcC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ" name="Review allocations" guid="_FYjVcC-1EeCIuIVnfbDXhQ">
    <sectionDescription>This step constitutes a review of the requirements, their deviations, and their allocations with an eye towards coverage&#xD;
(all subsystem requirements must be allocated), completeness (identify any missing requirements), and achievability.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>The purpose is to clearly delineate the required contributions of different engineering disciplines to the engineering&#xD;
development of a subsystem by allocating the requirements allocated to the subsystem by the system engineering team.</purpose>
