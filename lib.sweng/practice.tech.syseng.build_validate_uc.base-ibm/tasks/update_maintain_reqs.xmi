  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task establishes traceability from the use-case block operations and attributes to the&amp;nbsp;system requirements&#xD;
    that they implement.&amp;nbsp; This traceability information is initially used to ensure that each system requirement has&#xD;
    been considered and is implemented by at least one use-case block (coverage analysis).&amp;nbsp; Later in the lifecycle&#xD;
    this traceability information is used to assess the impact of proposed changes on the solution architecture.&#xD;
