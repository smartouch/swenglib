  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use case scenarios represent the interactions of the system executing the use case with the actors. Each scenario&#xD;
    represents a specific sequence of events, messages, and actions. Each of these elements captures at least part of a&#xD;
    requirement, and often more than one requirement, specifying a required or optional sequence, input and output events&#xD;
    and messages, and control and data transformations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A use case normally has between several and several dozen such scenarios and each scenario has typically several to&#xD;
    several dozen messages. The scenarios set is said to be 'minimally complete' when each functional or quality of service&#xD;
    requirement is represented on at least one scenario. Messages between the use case and the actor(s) are normally&#xD;
    represented as asynchronous events that optionally carry data. This constitutes the so-called 'logical interface'&#xD;
    between the actors and the system as it executes the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To capture a set of essential scenarios for each use case. These will be later on merged into a common workflow (described&#xD;
by an activity diagram).</purpose>
