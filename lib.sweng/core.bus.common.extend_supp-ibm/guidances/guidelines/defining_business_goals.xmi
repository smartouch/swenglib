    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Traditionally, business activities have been planned and measured with a very strong focus on financial performance. On&#xD;
    the one hand, managers might define both financial and nonfinancial objectives, while on the other hand they might be&#xD;
    interested only in the outcome of the financial measures.&amp;nbsp;This misalignment between objectives and measures leads,&#xD;
    sadly, to undesirable yet predictable behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The modern enterprise does not only have to be competitive financially, but to be so on a variety of different fronts.&#xD;
    Business goals must define more than just financial measures. They must also focus on, for example, employee&#xD;
    satisfaction or customer success. Simply defining different business goals is not enough to ensure success, because&#xD;
    certain goals might be measured or enforced more than others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Modeling business goals provides a technique for considering how the business strategy can be implemented in the short-&#xD;
    and long-term and for defining a balanced set of measures to ensure that business processes support the strategy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The question that arises from this issue is: How do you implement strategy, particularly one that could require radical&#xD;
    change?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Strategy and Business Goals&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business strategy defines the manner in which the organization needs to interact with its environment, so as to fulfill&#xD;
    its purpose. As such, business strategy is essentially focused on the external perspective of the organization, rather&#xD;
    than internally managing the organization. Business strategy and business goals are closely related: Business goals&#xD;
    define what needs to be achieved to realize a higher-level goal, while business strategy provides the boundaries within&#xD;
    which these goals will be defined. Strategy does not, however, prescribe specific goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Strategy is about &lt;b>positioning&lt;/b>. In business, strategy describes the desired competitive position of the&#xD;
    organization. The organization can fulfill its purpose once it finds itself in a sustainable competitive position.&#xD;
    Business goals describe what must be achieved to reach that desired competitive position. Both business strategy and&#xD;
    business goals are concerned with &lt;b>what&lt;/b> must be achieved and not how it will be achieved.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals should&amp;nbsp;focus on what provides competitive advantage to the organization, for only this is&#xD;
    strategic. We can conclude that business goals must define what must be achieved in order to reach a sustainable&#xD;
    competitive position.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>&lt;strong>Business Goal Hierarchy&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals are usually high level and have a long-term focus. However, business goals need to be translated to a&#xD;
    concrete, measurable level before they can be used to manage the activities of the business. Such a measurable and&#xD;
    time-constrained business goal is often referred to as an objective. Business goals therefore need to be arranged in a&#xD;
    hierarchy, with each business goal (or objective) traced back to the higher level goals it&amp;nbsp;supports. Without such&#xD;
    linkage, individuals and departments can optimize their local performance but not contribute to achieving strategic&#xD;
    objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is imperative to obtain clear insight into this hierarchy of business goals and how it is supported by the&#xD;
    activities of the business. This allows for rapidly propagating changes in direction from the strategic level downward.&#xD;
    This ability to rapidly change the direction of the entire operation is called &lt;b>strategic agility,&lt;/b> and it allows&#xD;
    the organization to react to changes faster than its competitors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here is an example of a business goal hierarchy in a payment services organization:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/bgo1.gif&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 1.&amp;nbsp; Sample business goal hierarchy&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The high-level business goal Customer Intimacy has been translated to business goals at a lower level, which are more&#xD;
    recognizable to individual departments within the organization. By defining these more concrete business goals, the&#xD;
    problem of objectively measuring customer intimacy is solved. Sometimes it is necessary to translate one or more of&#xD;
    these lower goals further.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Processes and Business Goals&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Goals are useless in themselves. They must be translated into action in order to be meaningful. Every business goal&#xD;
    needs to be directly supported by at least one business process.&amp;nbsp; If not, it needs to&amp;nbsp;be further defined in&#xD;
    terms of more concrete subgoals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It has always been difficult to define a business strategy and then derive objectives in support of this strategy for&#xD;
    different parts of the organization. Business processes in the modern enterprise are integrated and cross-functional,&#xD;
    and this actually makes the process of allocating business goals easier than before. Business goals are allocated to&#xD;
    parts of the organizational in terms of these integrated business processes, which add value to stakeholders of the&#xD;
    business. The contribution of one particular part of the organization to customer satisfaction, for example, can be&#xD;
    defined and measured.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Balanced Scorecard&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The answer to the question posed above must be sought in a method that gives the user insight into the course of action&#xD;
    taken. The method must also&amp;nbsp;indicate to the user the consequences of any action taken. One such method is the&#xD;
    Balanced Scorecard (BSC) by Kaplan and Norton [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.business_A6E7B212.html&quot; guid=&quot;_aCadgHF_Ed6Yfpy4DBGTEg&quot;>KN96&lt;/a>]. The BSC defines a technique for translating business strategy into business&#xD;
    goals and measures, thereby ensuring a balanced focus on achievement of all goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Kaplan and Norton write: &quot;Front-line employees must understand the financial consequences of their decisions and&#xD;
    actions; senior executives must understand the drivers of long-term financial success. The objectives and measures of&#xD;
    the Balanced Scorecard are ... derived from a top-down process driven by the mission and strategy of the business.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The theory behind the BSC is quite logical:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul style=&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 0in&quot; type=&quot;disc&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in&quot;     class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
        Know where you want the organization to be in the future (desired competitive position).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in&quot;     class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
        Know the business and the sort of organization required to reach that position (purpose, or mission).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in&quot;     class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
        Define the relationship between the mission and the activities of the business (business goals).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in&quot;     class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
        Define more precisely what is to be achieved and when the results are to be accomplished (operational objectives).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals are scored using four perspectives. It could be concluded that there are only four types of business&#xD;
    goals. However the method of scoring and thus the types&amp;nbsp;of business goals is arbitrary. An organization is free to&#xD;
    define more types as they are required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Financial Perspective&lt;/b>-Indicates what has happened in the past and measures what needs to be&amp;nbsp;performed to&#xD;
    achieve the financial objectives and check the performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Customer Perspective&lt;/b>-Looks at the present and indicates what needs to be accomplished to improve customer&#xD;
    relationship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Learning and Growth Perspective&lt;/b>-Looks at the future and what must be achieved to maintain growth and achieve&#xD;
    further improvement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Internal Process Perspective&lt;/b>-Looks at the present and indicates which internal processes must be performed with&#xD;
    excellence for customer and shareholder satisfaction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An important feature of the BSC is that there needs to be a cause-and-effect relationship between all the perspectives&#xD;
    and hence also between all the identified business goals. The following simple but effective example illustrates this.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;center>&#xD;
        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;484&quot; colspec=&quot;L13 L6 L7 L8 L7&quot;>&#xD;

                    &lt;/td>&#xD;
                    &lt;td style=&quot;PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 3.5pt; PADDING-RIGHT: 3.5pt; PADDING-TOP: 0in&quot;                     valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;266&quot;>&#xD;

                &lt;/tr>&#xD;

                    &lt;td style=&quot;PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 3.5pt; PADDING-RIGHT: 3.5pt; PADDING-TOP: 0in&quot;                     valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;192&quot;>&#xD;
                        &lt;p>&#xD;
                            Financial&#xD;
                        &lt;/p>&#xD;
                    &lt;/td>&#xD;
                    &lt;td style=&quot;PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 3.5pt; PADDING-RIGHT: 3.5pt; PADDING-TOP: 0in&quot;                     valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;266&quot;>&#xD;
                        &lt;p>&#xD;
                            Maintain or improve business profitability.&#xD;
                        &lt;/p>&#xD;
                    &lt;/td>&#xD;
                &lt;/tr>&#xD;
            &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
        &lt;/table>&#xD;
    &lt;/center>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This is an iterative process, because maintaining or improving profitability will enable the organization to keep&#xD;
    employing sufficient qualified staff. As Kaplan and Norton indicate, &quot;If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage&#xD;
    it.&quot;&amp;nbsp; It is imperative therefore that business goals can be measured objectively, either quantitatively or&#xD;
    qualitatively. (See the next section.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Measuring Goal Achievement&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Just the intention to achieve goals is not enough to ensure that the business strategy will be executed. People must&#xD;
    receive feedback on their actions in order to learn and improve.&amp;nbsp; By measuring the achievement of business goals,&#xD;
    business activities can be increasingly aligned with strategy.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measurements are useful for a number of reasons. First, measurements provide an indication of how successfully the&#xD;
    business strategy is being implemented at various levels of the business. Second, measurements give insight into the&#xD;
    effectiveness of goals. Finally, measurements provide a feedback mechanism with which minor adjustments can be made to&#xD;
    the strategy based on operating conditions. This feedback can also be accumulated and aggregated over a long period&#xD;
    with which the strategy can be adjusted more significantly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If business goals are not translated to sufficiently measurable levels within the organization, they might remain too&#xD;
    abstract for employees to relate to, which will make it very unlikely that people will strive to achieve the goals in&#xD;
    their daily tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current definition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/workproducts/business_goal_7868E071.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CPTfkFaiEd6MCpkuB85p5g&quot;>Artifact: Business Goal&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;includes the details to measure the goal in the future&#xD;
    whereas a more complete model commonly used in strategy modeling is shown in Figure 2.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/goal_kpi_metric.gif&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 2.&amp;nbsp; Goal-KPI-metric model&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Goal or sub-goal&lt;/b>: Organizations define goals to meet their mission and to set strategic direction. In SOMA, the&#xD;
    term goal denotes a business aspiration starting at a high level. For example a high level goal could be to increase&#xD;
    revenue. This goal can be decomposed into sub-goals such as &quot;increase revenue from &amp;lt;x&amp;gt;&quot;, and &quot;increase revenue&#xD;
    from &amp;lt;y&amp;gt;&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>KPI's&lt;/b>: KPIs are used to determine how well a business is meeting its goals, or to assess the level of&#xD;
    performance of business processes. For example, for the goal &quot;increase revenue&quot;, a specific KPI could be &quot;increase&#xD;
    revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year&quot;. This provides a specific way to determine if the goal has been met.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Metrics:&lt;/b> Metrics identify the type of measurements that need to be collected to assess the state of the KPIs.&#xD;
    For a KPI such as &quot;increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year&quot;, a metric could be &quot;record the revenue from all&#xD;
    revenue generating transactions&quot;. Measurements would then need to be taken of each relevant transaction, across all&#xD;
    systems that support those transactions. An implication of this is that all of the individual measurements dictated by&#xD;
    the metric would need to be aggregated and reported in a meaningful way so that it can be determined if the related KPI&#xD;
    has been met.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Resolving Goal Conflicts&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Due to the diverse nature of business goals, they might appear to conflict with one another. A typical example is for&#xD;
    call-center employees to service many customers in a specific time (throughput), yet deliver high quality of service to&#xD;
    each customer (which takes time). If the call-center manager rewards the employee with the most calls, the service&#xD;
    level will drop. On the other hand, if the manager rewards the employee with the most satisfied customers, the&#xD;
    throughput will drop. Volume versus time or quality versus cost are recognizable goal-conflict patterns to which&#xD;
    Eriksson and Penker refer. They also described a technique, using an association stereotyped&#xD;
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;contradictory&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, for explicitly modeling conflicts between business goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managers must be aware of this very common dilemma when setting business goals. However, the strategy of an&#xD;
    organization does not stand or fall on any single business goal, much the same as a war is not wan or lost by a single&#xD;
    battle. The direction of the organization is derived from the sum of all actions taken. It might therefore seem that a&#xD;
    business goal is counter-productive, but when the goal is measured as one part of the whole, the sum is actually&#xD;
    positive. This means that localized inefficiencies might actually contribute indirectly to the business strategy.&#xD;
    Nonetheless, not performing a minor &quot;course correction&quot; (because for example, somebody is more interested in the bonus&#xD;
    as a result of the performance of his or her own department) can put the organization as a whole at a disadvantage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Conclusion&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An organization has a vision, which is translated into a strategy.&amp;nbsp; The strategy&amp;nbsp;must be met by the business&#xD;
    goals that are ultimately measured in the operations of the organization. The vision is implemented by business workers&#xD;
    and business actors interacting to realize the business use cases. Business goals are the &quot;glue&quot; between the business&#xD;
    strategy and business use cases. If they are correctly defined, they will give the organization the required insight to&#xD;
    keep on course or to change course as required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals must be defined at a sufficiently high level in order to focus the entire organization on the vision.&#xD;
    Objectives and measures must be defined at a sufficiently low level within an organization in order that employees can&#xD;
    identify themselves with them. Business goals must be measurable to be effective, either quantitatively or by the sum&#xD;
    of subgoals (qualitatively).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are a number of techniques for defining and measuring business goals, one of which is the Balanced Scorecard.&#xD;
    Whatever technique is used, however, it needs to&amp;nbsp;be applied as a management tool and not solely as a measurement&#xD;
    instrument.&#xD;
