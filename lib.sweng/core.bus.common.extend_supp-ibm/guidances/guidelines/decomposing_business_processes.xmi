  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The level of business process detail that is initially created by a team of business analysts might be insufficient for&#xD;
    follow-on work that focuses on realizing the business process.&amp;nbsp; In that case, the process must be further&#xD;
    decomposed until it is fit for the required purpose.&amp;nbsp; This guideline provides some advice regarding approaches to&#xD;
    process decomposition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As is&amp;nbsp;discussed in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_70D1DA00.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0XDGMEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Concept: Business Process Decomposition&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;business process decomposition can&#xD;
    result in a hierarchy of processes and sub-processes, which eventually end in leaf-level sub-processes that&amp;nbsp;leave&#xD;
    us dealing with&amp;nbsp;fine-grained user actions.&amp;nbsp; The following figure is duplicated from that concept to&#xD;
    illustrate&amp;nbsp;a possible process hierarchy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/bus_proc_decomp_2.gif&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each level of process decomposition&amp;nbsp;can involve&amp;nbsp;a drill-down through the organizational functional structure&#xD;
    that was used to describe the previous level of the process.&amp;nbsp; So, a process description might involve the&#xD;
    interaction between business domains, which are the largest concepts used to describe business functional&#xD;
    structure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the next level, the sub-process that is the responsibility of a given domain might be&#xD;
    analyzed in terms of the interactions between the functional areas/business systems that comprise the domain.&amp;nbsp; Yet&#xD;
    another round of decomposition might find us examining how the sub-sub-process which is the responsibility of a given&#xD;
    business system might be realized by interactions between the business workers the business system owns.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recursive nature of the process decompositional drill-down calls out for a system-of-systems approach, where the&#xD;
    behaviors (processes) at each level of the overall system (that is, the business) are discovered using a consistent&#xD;
    method.&amp;nbsp; Further, the transition from one level of the process to the next needs to be managed consistently.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    Rational's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247368.html?Open&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Model Driven Systems&#xD;
    Development&lt;/a> (MDSD) method is a useful&amp;nbsp;approach for achieving a high degree of consistency in representation&#xD;
    and technique as you progress through your process decomposition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As we decompose the business processes, there are several things to consider and document:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Actors&lt;/strong> -- Each level of process description potentially will&amp;nbsp;have a different set of&#xD;
    actors.&amp;nbsp; At the top-most level, the actors are the actors which interact with the enterprise as a whole.&amp;nbsp; At&#xD;
    the next level down, as we isolate (for example) a given domain to understand how its functional areas interact to&#xD;
    realize the sub-process for which it is responsible, the enterprise actors remain -- but the other domains also become&#xD;
    actors!&amp;nbsp; Upon isolating a functional area for the next round of process analysis, the actors (for that specific&#xD;
    analysis) become the actors the domain dealt with -- plus the other functional areas within the domain!&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Events&lt;/strong> -- We need to identify the events that trigger a process or sub-process.&amp;nbsp; Identifying a&#xD;
    process (or certain of its steps)&amp;nbsp;as being event-driven can provide hints&amp;nbsp;regarding requirements that any&#xD;
    automated implementation support (for example) publish-and-subscribe&amp;nbsp;event notification.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Business entities&lt;/strong> that are involved in, or transformed by, the business process.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge&#xD;
    is important for subsequent specification of service messages and service operation signatures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Opportunities for automation.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All steps in a business process are not well-suited for&#xD;
    automation, and others certainly are.&amp;nbsp; Be focused on discriminating between these two.&amp;nbsp; Lack of&#xD;
    discrimination can lead to wasted effort on the one hand, and missed opportunity on the other.&amp;nbsp; One caution,&#xD;
    though -- be aware that what might not be a good candidate for automation today, might be a great candidate&#xD;
    later.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to flag manual process steps that are particularly costly or error-prone.&amp;nbsp; They might be good&#xD;
    candidates for consideration at a later time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Geographical distribution&lt;/strong> among the entities that are involved in executing a process.&amp;nbsp; Spatial&#xD;
    distribution of processing elements can impose more taxing non-functional requirements on process elements.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    sooner this is realized, the better.&#xD;
