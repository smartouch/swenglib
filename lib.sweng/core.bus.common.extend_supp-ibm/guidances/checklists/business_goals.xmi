  <sections xmi:id="_EB-EMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Do all Business Domains and Functional Areas have defined goals" guid="_EB-EMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Each&amp;nbsp;business domain and functional area (collectively, &quot;business system&quot;)&amp;nbsp;needs to be guided by goals. These&#xD;
goals&amp;nbsp;can either be unique to the domain/area or sub-goals of goals defined for the business as a whole. There will&#xD;
usually be a parallel decomposition of goals and business systems with each system having its own goals and inheriting&#xD;
goals from parent systems.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_gidpMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is the goal related to competitive advantage" guid="_gidpMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Goals, in general,&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;encompass areas of competitive advantage and&amp;nbsp;must be leading a business to expand&#xD;
on such advantages. Obviously some business goals are related more to the management of the business, but these&amp;nbsp;need&#xD;
to&amp;nbsp;be outnumbered by those representing business competencies.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_k0NLMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is the name unique" guid="_k0NLMHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>It is important to uniquely name goals so as to ensure that goals can be easily distinguished. It is also possible to use a&#xD;
hierarchical numbering system as a part of the goals name; for example (1) for the parent goals, (1.1), (1.2), etc. for&#xD;
sub-goals.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_osTeIHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Does the name reflect the intention of the goal" guid="_osTeIHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The name of a goal&amp;nbsp;needs to&amp;nbsp;reflect its intention; while a goal has a description field it will most often be&#xD;
    presented in reports and other material simply by its name.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_tqTCIHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is the goal unambiguous" guid="_tqTCIHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Is the description of the goal unambiguous? All stakeholders&amp;nbsp;must be able to agree not only on the validity of a goal&#xD;
but also its meaning and value.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_xUsQQHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Are KPIs included for all goals" guid="_xUsQQHM3Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>All goals&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be supported by a set of Key Performance Indicators which describe the manner in which the&#xD;
business will measure success. A goal that has sub-goals can choose to not have explicit KPIs&amp;nbsp;if its sub-goals have&#xD;
defined and measurable KPIs.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When using the UML Profile for Business Modeling, each Business Goal has an associated change value (in lieu of a&#xD;
    separate KPI) which&amp;nbsp;must be consistent with the specified change kind.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>When using the UML Profile for Business Modeling, each Business Goal has an associated change date (in lieu of a separate&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_O_sgkHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is it clear how the goal contributes to any higher-level goals it supports" guid="_O_sgkHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Each sub-goal&amp;nbsp;must clearly support any higher-level goal. A parent goal can choose to not have associated KPIs if it&#xD;
is clear how all sub-goal KPIs can be combined to define its own measures.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_U9AzkHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is there at least one business use case, or business process, that traces to the goal" guid="_U9AzkHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>The primary mechanism for a business to enact its goals is through the execution of business processes. Business processes&#xD;
might be represented either directly using a process modeling tool, or might be represented using a Business Use Case (with&#xD;
the UML Profile for Business Modeling).</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Goals&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be validated to ensure they do not conflict; this is particularly important in a goal model where&#xD;
sub-goals might be modeled and maintained by different business organizations.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_fDkz4HM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is the goal traced to other goals to which it might contribute" guid="_fDkz4HM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Goals might form a hierarchy with goal/sub-goal relationships. It is also possible for a goal model to form more of a&#xD;
network or matrix with sub-goals contributing to more than one parent goal. Ensure that all such relationships are&#xD;
explicitly modeled.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A goal model needs to be precise enough to be measurable and enactable; if you have less than three levels, you must&#xD;
    verify whether these goals are concrete enough to be measurable. If more than seven,&amp;nbsp;consider flattening the&#xD;
    hierarchy.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_yTT_MHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg" name="Is the goal hierarchy reasonably balanced" guid="_yTT_MHM4Ed6va-EJWoOsvg">
    <sectionDescription>Do different sub-trees at the same level in the hierarchy have similar depth? If not, it might indicate that one area has&#xD;
received more attention than others.</sectionDescription>
