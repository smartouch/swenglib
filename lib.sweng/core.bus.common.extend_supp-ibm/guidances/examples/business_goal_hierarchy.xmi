  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Imagine a large furniture store that sells quality furniture at a reasonable price to the very large middle-market. The&#xD;
    store's showrooms are attached to a warehouse where customers can pick up the items they have purchased. Alternatively,&#xD;
    customers can arrange to have large items delivered. A business goal hierarchy for this company might look as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram shows more complex hierarchy of business goals for a furniture store.&quot;     src=&quot;./resources/bgo2.gif&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business goal &lt;em>Reasonable Quality&lt;/em> is sufficient to retain existing customers but will not serve to attract&#xD;
    new customers. People will not go to shop somewhere because the quality is no less than competitors. People will be&#xD;
    attracted to shopping there because prices are lower and it is convenient.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It might have been determined that product quality meets customers' expectations and that no quality improvements are&#xD;
    therefore necessary. However, facilities might need to be improved. The business goal &lt;em>Improve Facility Quality&lt;/em>&#xD;
    might be further divided into things like &lt;em>Sufficient Parking&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Clean Restrooms&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Multilingual&#xD;
    Signs&lt;/em>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It must be possible to measure business goals; otherwise, they&amp;nbsp;need to be refined further. Prices can be&#xD;
    objectively compared to competitors' prices, whereas convenience for customers is very difficult to measure. Therefore,&#xD;
    &lt;em>Customer Convenience&lt;/em> has been subdivided into &lt;em>Accessibility&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Immediate Availability&lt;/em>, and&#xD;
    &lt;em>Opening Times&lt;/em>, which are more concrete ways to measure customer convenience. &lt;em>Opening Times&lt;/em> can be&#xD;
    optimized, for example, by measuring the number of people in the store during every hour of the day.&#xD;
    &lt;em>Accessibility&lt;/em> can be (partly) determined by the number of payment methods available to customers. The&#xD;
    immediate availability of products is defined by the stock-on-hand, which can be measured by the percentage of back&#xD;
    orders directly requested by customers, and the delivery time, which can also be objectively measured.&#xD;
