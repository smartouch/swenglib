  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this example, we consider an automobile rental company.&amp;nbsp; We are working in the current project&amp;nbsp;to improve&#xD;
    the core aspects of rental management.&amp;nbsp; We identify five domains, those being:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Marketing and Customer Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rentals Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rental Fleet Logistics&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Administration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For now, we will focus on the first four domains.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;>Identifying the Functional Areas&lt;/font>&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each domain is analyzed to identify the major functions it is responsible for. Analysis results can be captured in a&#xD;
    visual model that groups functional areas by domain.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For Rent-a-car, we break the domains into functional areas by identifying major functional responsibilities for each&#xD;
    domain in focus: Marketing and Customer management, Products, Rental Fleet Logistics, and Rentals Management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A major functional area of the Marketing and Customer Management domain is &lt;strong>Customer Service&lt;/strong>. For this&#xD;
    example, we fill focus on this area.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the Products domain, &lt;strong>Promotions Management&lt;/strong> is a major functional area identified for further&#xD;
    analysis, because promotions affect rental pricing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Fleet Management&lt;/strong> is a major functional area for the Rental Fleet Logistics domain that plays a role in&#xD;
    the reservation process, for example where vehicle availability information is important.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Rentals Management has been decomposed into three major functional areas: &lt;strong>Rental&lt;/strong>,&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Reservations&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Pricing&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;The Reservation and Rental functional areas provide&#xD;
    the most customer visible aspects of the car rental experience. Pricing is a key function for completing a reservation,&#xD;
    as well as for completion of the vehicle rental at check-in.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These will be the core functional areas for this example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is actually an overlap across several domains regarding pricing, but we have chosen to emphasize just the pricing&#xD;
    aspect of Rentals Management, because&amp;nbsp;this is the aspect of pricing that is most directly related to the example.&#xD;
    The Products domain establishes baseline pricing guidelines that account for standard cost and profit policies.&#xD;
    Marketing and Customer Management information combined with information from Rental Fleet Logistics information and&#xD;
    other marketplace related criteria supports special promotional pricing by the Products domain. Marketing and Customer&#xD;
    Management influences the criteria by which pricing schedules are applied to various customer types.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Nevertheless, whatever led to the establishment of pricing schedules, in this specific&amp;nbsp;example, it is Rentals&#xD;
    Management where the prices are actually used during the reservation and rental. In a different scenario, other aspects&#xD;
    of pricing could be the focus area.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Further analysis will consider the interdependencies that begin to emerge as analysis delves deeper into these&#xD;
    functions. For example, as part of Reservations, it would be advantageous to adjust pricing due to oversupply of&#xD;
    vehicles of a particular class at a particular location that Fleet Management is aware of.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each functional area is described with a concise textual explanation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Further analysis -- such as mapping&#xD;
    the functional areas into business processes or performing business use case&amp;nbsp;analysis --&amp;nbsp;would reveal the&#xD;
    services each functional area requires and offers, as well as&amp;nbsp;which functional areas are related due to needs to&#xD;
    communicate during the execution of the business processes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
