  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business&amp;nbsp;goals&amp;nbsp;define what must be achieved in order to reach a sustainable competitive position.&amp;nbsp; They&#xD;
    are the &quot;glue&quot; between the description of an organization's vision (the desired position)&amp;nbsp;and the strategy that is&#xD;
    defined to realize the vision.&amp;nbsp; If business goals are correctly defined, they will give the organization the&#xD;
    required insight to keep on course or to change course as required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Traditionally, business&amp;nbsp;goals have been planned and measured with a very strong focus on financial performance,&#xD;
    because this is &quot;easy&quot; to measure.&amp;nbsp; However, enterprises need to be competitive&amp;nbsp;on a variety of fronts.&#xD;
    Business goals&amp;nbsp;should define more than just financial measures. For example,&amp;nbsp;employee satisfaction or&#xD;
    customer success are characteristics that greatly impact the long-term performance of the enterprise, and therefore&#xD;
    they are worthy of being measured.&amp;nbsp; Goals&amp;nbsp;also need to be evaluated and prioritized so the&#xD;
    organization&amp;nbsp;can focus its resources on the most important aspects of the business.&#xD;
