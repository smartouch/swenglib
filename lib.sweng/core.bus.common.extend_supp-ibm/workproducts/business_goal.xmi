  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals describe specific things that are important for the business to achieve. High level goals can be&#xD;
    decomposed into sub-goals that become increasingly narrower in scope and definition. KPIs are associated with each goal&#xD;
    and sub-goal to identify what managers of a company look at to determine the degree of success or organizational&#xD;
    performance relative to business goals. Metrics associated with each KPI are individual features that can be measured&#xD;
    to support the assessment of KPIs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The taxonomy is therefore:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        High level business goals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sub-goals decomposed from the high level business goals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with each goal and sub-goal&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Metrics associated with each KPI that can be used to identify what measurements need to be captured and analyzed to&#xD;
        assess whether goals are being met&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of Business Goals is to translate the business strategy into measurable steps with which the business&#xD;
    operations can be steered in the right direction and improved if necessary. These quantifiable measures enable&#xD;
    realistic expectations to be set regarding improvements to the business and&amp;nbsp;enable objective measurement of&#xD;
    progress when implementing changes and improvements to the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business managers and stakeholders use Business Goals to translate the business strategy into concrete measures.&#xD;
    Business-process analysts and business designers use Business Goals to verify that business processes are aligned with&#xD;
    the business strategy.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
