  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Do what you say, say what you do&quot; is the main principle behind the Rational Team Concert (RTC) and Rational Method&#xD;
    Composer (RMC) integration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Process descriptions are captured, managed and tailored in RMC and published as a method website. The process&#xD;
    description can be viewed, searched and navigated using a web browser. However, the goal is to surface the relevant&#xD;
    process guidance directly in practitioner tools so practitioners have the guidance they need, when and where they need&#xD;
    it to complete their work. The RTC/RMC integration provides this capability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Process enactment takes advantage of the RTC's planning and tracking capabilities. Work Item Templates are used to&#xD;
    quickly create a set of related work items, including predecessor/successor and parent/child relationships, based on&#xD;
    proven patterns of success. The IBM Rational solutions include both a process description and a matching RTC process&#xD;
    template that includes a set of work item templates. Each work item created from these work item templates provides&#xD;
    links to the relevant process guidance. This makes it easy for practitioners to complete their work, and simplifies&#xD;
    process adoption and compliance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Furthermore, Rational Method Composer also provides capabilities to generate work item templates directly into an&#xD;
    existing RTC project area. This makes it possible to quickly tailor the process description and create work item&#xD;
    templates aligned with and linked to the updated method guidance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To evaluate some of these capabilities, perform the following steps:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a project area&amp;nbsp;in RTC based on the provided Process Template&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On the main project page follow the link to the process guidance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a set of work items based on the Work Item Templates included with the Process Template&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Follow the link in the description field of one of the work items to view the relevant process guidance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information on how to get started with RTC, see the guidelines under the &quot;Getting Started with the Evaluation&quot;&#xD;
    folder.&#xD;
