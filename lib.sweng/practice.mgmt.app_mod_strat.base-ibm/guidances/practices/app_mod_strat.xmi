  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine Application modernization strategy is a process that takes current state of applications and use various&#xD;
    metrics derived out of the application source code. To define a strategy alternatives and road map that will attain&#xD;
    business/organization goals for the applications.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Information gathered from current state analysis of the application architectural combined with metrics from&#xD;
    application source code help identify application components, system flow, data flow, functional system dependencies,&#xD;
    system integration points, complexity and pockets of functional density. This can also lead to uncovering the cause of&#xD;
    issues/concerns with the application that are raised by stake holders.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Application code analysis is static code analysis that requires reading of code through analysis tools, to understand&#xD;
    the structure of the application with associated metrics (Complexity, size, maintainability index, functional index â€¦&#xD;
    etc).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A workshop (meeting) is to be conducted after gathering enough metrics and understanding application architecture with&#xD;
    all the stake holders and interested people to present preliminary analysis. This event helps validate findings and&#xD;
    understand requirements or goals of the organization with the application under consideration. Workshop provides direct&#xD;
    inputs that will help formulate a strategy alternatives and modernization road map.&#xD;

  <problem>The purpose of this practice is to help identify application modernization road map and strategies alternatives&amp;nbsp;to&#xD;
resolve application maintenance cost and application time to value issues. It provides a better understanding of the&#xD;
targeted application and how it can be improved to resolve associated business problems.</problem>
