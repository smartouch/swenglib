    Deliver Assessment Presentation and Report&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the workshop is to gather the executive sponsors and senior IT leaders together to strategize on how to&#xD;
    issue the recommendations. These IT leaders include directors, managers, enterprise architects, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this workshop, a senior assessor delivers a concise presentation of the findings to key stakeholders and other&#xD;
    interested parties. The Findings Presentation briefly outlines the approach the assessment team followed and then&#xD;
    focuses on the findings and recommendations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When delivering the findings, it is important to maintain a balance between the areas of strength and areas for&#xD;
    improvement. When you address areas for improvement, try to clearly and objectively express the root cause(s) of each&#xD;
    one, as well as the degree of the impact on the business. While exact quantification of impact is usually impractical&#xD;
    and risky for most assessments, the strongest findings frequently indicate the nature of the impact in terms of&#xD;
    cost/effort, schedule, or quality with a potential order or range of magnitude. Remember, the solution value and sense&#xD;
    of urgency is often measured by the significance of the identified problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to delivering recommendations, it is highly beneficial to elicit stakeholder feedback to gain support of the&#xD;
    findings and establish initial priorities. Frequently, stakeholders are well-aware of many or all of the issues&#xD;
    expressed in the findings, in which case they will likely be receptive to the recommendations. However, if the&#xD;
    stakeholders are resistant to the findings, the senior assessor can need to facilitate a discussion to clarify areas of&#xD;
    disagreement before moving on to recommendations. In extreme circumstances, the senior assessor (with agreement from&#xD;
    the sponsor) can choose to postpone delivery of recommendations, if the underlying assumptions are called into&#xD;
    question.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When delivering the recommendations portion, try to convey that intention is to enable them to achieve their business&#xD;
    goals. It is appropriate to review these business goals with the stakeholders to establish a sound foundation for the&#xD;
    recommendations. For each recommendation, the most effective presentation clearly and objectively expresses how each&#xD;
    one: 1) addresses the root cause(s) of the deficiencies previously identified in the findings, 2) promotes the business&#xD;
    goals, and 3) provides a rough indication of the implementation effort/time frame. Again, it is appropriate to elicit&#xD;
    stakeholder feedback to gain support to the findings, revisit initial priorities, and gauge the level of stakeholder&#xD;
    urgency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the presenter, you must be prepared to discuss the identified issues and recommendations, as well as answer&#xD;
    questions about what the recommended solution would involve. Try to keep this meeting to no longer than two hours. If&#xD;
    the customer wants more discussion than can be accomplished in that time, it indicates that there is follow-on work&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this workshop there is no need to deliver the application enhancement road map or strategy even if it is already&#xD;
    prepared. However, it is important to be aware of that so that brief question can be answered. It is important to gauge&#xD;
    the interest if the sponsors and other interested parties to see if recommendations are acceptable to them. This will&#xD;
    go a long way in gauging the interest of the sponsors to accept a particular road map.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important for the sponsoring executives to participate, to communicate and clarify to the IT leaders the business&#xD;
    goals related to application improvements, the significance of the goals and their expected time frame for achievement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IT leaders have the opportunity to negotiate the scope and time frames for implementing the new enhancements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The ideal workshop results are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A set of improvements desired&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The projects or organizations committed to undertaking the pilots&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A set of objectives to be achieved by the strategies traced back to one or more of the business goals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A leadership team (guiding coalition) responsible for driving organization change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The outcome of the workshop will directly feed the Create and Application enhancement road map activity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the workshop you can perform the following activities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have the executives review or reiterate the business goals for Application improvements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the assessment recommendations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List candidate applications for enhancement/improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Access application timeliness and capacity for change, agree upon objectives that can be delivered by each of the&#xD;
        candidate application; gain agreement that agreed-to objectives satisfy goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select pilot applications from the candidate list; finalize agreement upon the applications to be enhanced; agree&#xD;
        upon potential schedule.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Agree upon measures for the objectives to be accomplished.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Aside from tasks 1 &amp;amp; 2, the tasks are not necessarily sequential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Input:&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Analysis data from current state analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Analysis data from application code analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Output:&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Origination goals and past experiences&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Willingness to accept certain changes to the application environment&lt;br />&#xD;
