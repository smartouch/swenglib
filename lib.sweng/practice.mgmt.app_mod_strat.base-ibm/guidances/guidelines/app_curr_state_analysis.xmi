    Data Gathering for Current State Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An important element in any analysis of application current state is the collection of data to confirm the suspicions&#xD;
    about what is wrong with the application. Because many types of data could be collected and considering the fact that&#xD;
    there is limited amount of time in which to collect this data, selection of appropriate data becomes paramount in&#xD;
    importance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following guidelines will help in decide what data will be most important to consider.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    What is wrong with the application just the way it is now?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the knowledge of development team, identify the major problems with the application. These problems can be&#xD;
    varied: poor quality, duplicated steps, unnecessary checks, performance, no documentation, high failure rate, user&#xD;
    complaint and unsatisfactory outcomes to name just a few. These suspicions can be validated or discarded with&#xD;
    appropriate data. For example: If analysis shows that &quot;impact due to a change&quot; is a problem, estimate the personnel&#xD;
    costs incurred as a result of&amp;nbsp;this change and identify the underlying reason, such as &quot;no&#xD;
    documentation&quot;.&amp;nbsp;This mapping of cause and effect are not only useful in understanding the current state and pain&#xD;
    points, but can begin to establish measures that could be used to evaluate a future state.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    What do we not know that would be good to know before we begin planning a future state?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This can mean collecting data on the volume of transactions, the number of times data is processed, the actual business&#xD;
    requirements and goals, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A final rule of thumb is to be very selective and go after a few, three or four, key facts that will do the most to&#xD;
    highlight what is wrong with the current application. Go first after data that already exists and avoid the temptation&#xD;
    to begin lengthy studies that cannot be completed in the available time. One hundred percent sampling is not necessary.&#xD;
    Absolute precision is not important - just reasonable approximations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It will be most effective if the assessment team begin asking themselves these questions while flowcharting the current&#xD;
    state of the application. For issues reported, assessor needs to ask, &quot;Is there objective data that we could get our&#xD;
    hands on that would help put that issue in perspective?&quot; Keep in mind that the purpose of a current state analysis is&#xD;
    to identify the underlying causes of business issue with the application.&lt;br />&#xD;
