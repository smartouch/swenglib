    Determine application modernization strategy requires agreement at the appropriate level that control application&#xD;
    development, maintenance, deployment and distribution. Not all applications in a given organization have similar&#xD;
    control structure. It is common for stake holders to have no direct control over the application.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This practice describes typical approach to determine application modernization strategy.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    1. Plan and prepare the Assessment&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1.1. Establish the Assessment team&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.2. Conduct the executive session&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.3. Coordinate with the sponsor&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.4. Deliver an Assessment Survey&lt;br />&#xD;
    2. Application Discovery&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.1. Inventory Application code&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.2. Prepare the findings&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.3. Present and deliver the findings&lt;br />&#xD;
    3. Modernization road map&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.1. Conduct SME Workshop&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.2. Conduct Analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.3. Prepare road map strategy alternatives recommended modernization strategy&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3.4. Present and deliver application modernization road map&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This practice is a good starting point that provides some basic steps to determine application modernization strategy.&#xD;
    Multiple or more complex application (such as application contains large number of 3rd party parts or application&#xD;
    sharing multiple components with other applications) might need additional steps and detail analysis of more than a&#xD;
    single application before a strategy can be developed. However, consider starting with this basic set, and then adding&#xD;
    additional applications analysis to the mix as needed.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Common Pitfalls&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Scope:&lt;/strong> It is important to distinguish between core application and its environment. To determine&#xD;
    application modernization strategy this practice will take the application environment into account. However, its scope&#xD;
    is limited to the determine modernization strategy of the core application and not its sounding environment. In some&#xD;
    cases significant effort will be required to filter the core application functionality from its surrounding&#xD;
    environment.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Shared components:&lt;/strong> Application can share large section of the code with other applications for&#xD;
    functional or efficiency reasons. This can increase the scope of analysis beyond a given application. Decision will be&#xD;
    required to take on additional analysis or treat common code as black box depending on the shared code and given&#xD;
    application. Typically third party code can be treated as black box.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Uninterested staff:&lt;/strong> This practice is fairly non-invasive in that it only requires very little time&#xD;
    from most project teams. If they insist that team members do not have any time to spend on this effort, then this is an&#xD;
    indicator that the project or organization is in trouble. It's even more critical to build the right solution and right&#xD;
    plan, based on input from the projects. Assure the staff that this will use their time as effectively as possible&#xD;
    during the interviews. In worst case it is important to inform the stake holders that this can affect outcome.&lt;br />&#xD;
