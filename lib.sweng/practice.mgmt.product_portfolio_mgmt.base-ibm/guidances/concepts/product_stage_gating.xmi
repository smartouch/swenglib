  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A stage-gate model is a roadmap for progressing a product from initial idea to availability, with specific decision&#xD;
    points or &lt;em>gates&lt;/em> at which you decide whether to approve the product's progression to the next stage. Stage&#xD;
    gating can reduce investment risk, because you approve funding at incremental intervals, with multiple opportunities to&#xD;
    review and re-examine a product's execution, expected benefits, risks, and outlook. Not all products will make it&#xD;
    through all of the gates; some may be stopped at the outset, while others may be stopped partway through.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This concept page defines stage gating based on the Stage-Gate&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;model of the Product Development Institute (&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkwithUsertext&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_ppm-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_ppm_2B9FAE39.html#PDI&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_6mjXsBV1Ed6nGok44QVaLg&quot;>PDI)&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Stages&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The stages you define for your product will depend on your processes and level of formality. You may define different&#xD;
    stage-gate models for different types of products.&amp;nbsp;For example, a brand-new product would follow a different path&#xD;
    than a minor upgrade to an existing product; a highly strategic or business-critical product would differ from a less&#xD;
    strategic product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A product typically begins in an idea or concept stage, and progresses through one or more evaluation stages to&#xD;
    establish feasibility and business case, before a gate approval to release it to development for implementation. After&#xD;
    a product is in development, it might go through stages for implementation, validation, and approval for release or&#xD;
    launch.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each stage consists of a set of activities and deliverables to be completed by a cross-functional team. The team&#xD;
    gathers information and completes work to reduce project uncertainties and risks and to advance the state of the&#xD;
    product artifacts.&amp;nbsp;The deliverables are input to the gate decision and to the next stage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Gates&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gates are at specified points of the Stage-Gate model.&amp;nbsp;At each gate, decision-makers assess whether to continue&#xD;
    investment in the product based on these factors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Execution results from the current stage.&lt;/strong> Are the required deliverables complete and of required&#xD;
        quality?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Current business case.&lt;/strong> Will the product produce the desired benefits, return on investment, and&#xD;
        strategic impact?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Plan for next stage.&lt;/strong> Does the investment for the next stage fit within&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
        organization's&amp;nbsp;resource capacity, prioritization, and risk, and is the plan reasonable?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The outcome of the gate decision is one of the following decisions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Proceed to the next stage, with continued investment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cancel the project and stop all investment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Suspend the project at this stage for possible future progression.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Redirect the product team to revise the work in the current stage and come back with additional information or&#xD;
        deliverables.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The formality of the gate decision depends on your organization and processes, and that may vary by project type or by&#xD;
    gate.&amp;nbsp;Although it's advisable to document the outcome of each gate decision, you can do this either formally with&#xD;
    an artifact state transition or with more informal documentation.&#xD;
