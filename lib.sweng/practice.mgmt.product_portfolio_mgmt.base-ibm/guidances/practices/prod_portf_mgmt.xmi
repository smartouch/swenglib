  <problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managing products by using traditional product management techniques and models has proven to be effective in&#xD;
    environments with a single or a fairly small set of products or in environments where product managers have autonomy&#xD;
    from one another and do not share scarce and critical resources that are necessary to implement their&#xD;
    plans.&amp;nbsp;However, in larger-scale corporate environments where many products exists, where product managers need to&#xD;
    tightly coordinate their efforts to operate with shared teams, and where the profitability of each product needs to be&#xD;
    validated and positioned in relation to the larger strategies of the organization, this practice provides the extended&#xD;
    breadth and scope to cater to the needs of portfolio executives who are accountable to the overall profitability and&#xD;
    worth of the product investment strategies and actions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Fundamental notions and practices of portfolio management that have already proven effective when applied to project&#xD;
    portfolio management within IT environments can be ported over the world of &quot;products&quot; (hard goods or&amp;nbsp;software&#xD;
    products). They can also be adapted to reflect the specific business conditions, criteria, parameters, and&#xD;
    characteristics that are needed to evolve a product portfolio management framework that drives the decision-making&#xD;
    models needed by product portfolio executives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A standardized portfolio management framework provides the repeatable and predictable foundation for traditional&#xD;
    product management models to evolve into broader and adaptable support for executive decisions. This framework also&#xD;
    supports investment models that maximize benefits while minimizing risks, thereby optimizing the firm's return on&#xD;
    investment (ROI) and return on assets (ROA).&#xD;
