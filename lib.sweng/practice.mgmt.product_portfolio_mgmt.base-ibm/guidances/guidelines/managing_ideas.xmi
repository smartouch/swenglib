  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process of managing ideas can be best described as an &lt;em>idea or innovation pipeline&lt;/em> in which &quot;best of breed&quot;&#xD;
    organizations apply a systematic and repeatable series of idea management or innovation processes to advance an idea&#xD;
    from its inception to delivery.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Idea management processes vary from one organization to another, and&amp;nbsp;they are dependent on the product management&#xD;
    method that the organization uses (such as&amp;nbsp;Stage Gate or Pragmatic Marketing).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Sources of ideas&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the Product Management Hub diagram in Figure 1 depicts, there can be numerous sources of ideas and product&#xD;
    requirements. It is essential that the idea management process to be employed for&amp;nbsp;managing product&#xD;
    portfolios&amp;nbsp;include the identification of the sources from which ideas are required (or expected) to be collected,&#xD;
    as well as the process by which they will be captured.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Product management hub illustrating the potential sources of ideas and product requirements&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key objective of managing ideas is to establish a process framework that effectively supports the receipt and&#xD;
    advancement of ideas in a manner that is responsive to market needs and profitable to the organization.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Receiving and qualifying idea submissions&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process defined for receiving and registering ideas should strive to systematically capture vital information that&#xD;
    facilitates the validation of the idea's worthiness for consideration. Information such as the market problem&#xD;
    addressed, strategic alignment, affected markets, risk, and return on investment (ROI) are examples of data points that&#xD;
    help to ensure that an idea is qualified to be considered for selection.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Prioritization of ideas and requests&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For all product and project portfolios, the challenge is to balance scope against the constraints of schedule, budget,&#xD;
    staff resources, business needs, and quality goals.&amp;nbsp;For the trade-off decisions that need to be made to achieve an&#xD;
    optimal balance, you must give consideration to&amp;nbsp;what information and data points must be provisioned so that you&#xD;
    can judge and measure the relative importance of one idea or request in relation to others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To enable management to distinguish the relative values of different ideas, it is essential to consider information&#xD;
    such as strategic alignment, estimated value contribution, risk and cost to implement, competitive advantage,&#xD;
    compliance and regulatory implications, and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the organization has adopted and established SWOT&amp;nbsp;(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) data for&#xD;
    its various products, the ability to determine how an idea or request improves a product's SWOT position will also help&#xD;
    to ensure that the right ideas or requests rank higher in the selection process.&#xD;
