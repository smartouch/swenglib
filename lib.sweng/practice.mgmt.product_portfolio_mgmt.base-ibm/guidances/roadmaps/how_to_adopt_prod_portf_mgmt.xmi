    Getting started:&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Portfolio Management practice is driven by the ever-increasing competitive pressures placed on&#xD;
    organizations to constantly innovate as a way to produce more for less, all the time. Although more traditionally seen&#xD;
    as a framework to manage consumer products purchased by &lt;em>external&lt;/em> customers (tangible goods and software&#xD;
    products), it is now equally important for organizations that are developing large-scale applications to be used by&#xD;
    &lt;em>internal&lt;/em> corporate customers and stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The time and effort required to develop large-scale portfolio management process reference models from scratch can be&#xD;
    substantial. Therefore, consider adopting a generalized process framework that can be adapted to reflect the specific&#xD;
    criteria, business conditions, and characteristics of your organization, instead.&amp;nbsp;This not only optimizes the&#xD;
    time-to-value of this process, but also provides a foundation that can be ported to other areas of the business where&#xD;
    portfolio management can generate value, such as project portfolios, application portfolios, and process improvement&#xD;
    portfolios.&amp;nbsp;That us why this Product Portfolio Management practice has been developed from a generalized version&#xD;
    of a portfolio management model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although this reference model might not represent all of the specific varieties and concepts that your organization&#xD;
    wants to include, working from this model provides a 90% solution that requires minimal effort to adapt and, most&#xD;
    important, provides a foundation of best practices that have been harvested from specialized consultants and proven&#xD;
    models over the years.&amp;nbsp;By using this model, your organization can focus on the most important components that&#xD;
    reflect its particular nature, such as these elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Classifications of work requests (such as projects, enhancements, and support)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Standardized formats to capture the required data&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Critical data elements (such as competitive data, differentiating features, and unique capabilities)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritization and selection criteria&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Representative analysis and decision models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Executive decision matrices and criteria&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reporting and publishing formats that can be understood and used across the organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given the immediate priorities of the organization, deployment of all three main activities of portfolio management&#xD;
    (Define and Prioritize, Balance and Authorize, Monitor the Portfolio and Conduct Reviews) is not&#xD;
    recommended.&amp;nbsp;Instead, select the activity that reflects the most urgent need of the organization and that people&#xD;
    are mostly likely to be ready and willing to adopt. However, it is typical to approach the deployment of this process&#xD;
    model in the natural order of the activities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define and Prioritize.&lt;/strong> Process all requests submitted for the portfolios so that proper&#xD;
        classification and standardized evaluation can lead to effective prioritization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Balance and Authorize.&lt;/strong> Assess and select the most beneficial sets of components to maximize the&#xD;
        portfolio value yet minimize risk.&amp;nbsp;It is critical to authorize only the work that has been approved by the&#xD;
        portfolio executives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Monitor the Portfolio and Conduct Reviews.&lt;/strong> Conduct regular and cyclical reviews to monitor all&#xD;
        work in progress, as well as to identify deviations and changes required to maintain an optimal portfolio that is&#xD;
        aligned with the organization's strategic objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are common pitfalls experienced when adopting a portfolio management model, including the ones listed in the&#xD;
    following subsections.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Trying to do it all at once&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As discussed previously, a common pitfall is to deploy the end-to-end portfolio management process as a single&#xD;
    effort.&amp;nbsp;The most important factor to a successful process initiative is obtaining high levels of adoption. There&#xD;
    are considerable changes and significant cultural impact caused by the implementation of a structured mechanism to do&#xD;
    what has been done intuitively and regulated by the instincts of a select few executives. Depending on the urgency and&#xD;
    readiness of the organization for a particular portion of a Product Portfolio Management model, determine which of&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;three main activities will provide the most value to the organization, and then focus on that activity&#xD;
    initially.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &quot;Homemade&quot; portfolio management framework, created from scratch&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some organizations might decide to undertake the development of their own portfolio management model, because their&#xD;
    needs are so unique. In doing so, they waste tremendous time and effort, which takes them away from focusing their&#xD;
    scarce resources on distinctive competencies and differentiating capabilities. They end up owning and needing to&#xD;
    maintain a model that the industry should be providing and maintaining, instead.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The advantage of using the model proposed by this practice is that several dimensions of this model can be adapted,&#xD;
    streamlined, and expanded over time. You can select&amp;nbsp;how much is initially adapted by starting with relatively&#xD;
    little process adaptation. Instead, for initial deployment, focus on including critical data, specific scorecards,&#xD;
    criteria, and analysis models that are proven to work within your organization.&amp;nbsp;Once feedback from portfolio&#xD;
    stakeholders&amp;nbsp;is harvested on process areas to be improved, added, or deleted, the progressive and evolutionary&#xD;
    nature of the process framework will encourage adoption and result in quicker payback to the organization.&#xD;
