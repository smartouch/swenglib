  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The creation of a&amp;nbsp;product roadmap is one of the most important responsibilities of the product manager. The&#xD;
    product roadmap is used by the product manager to communicate with customers and internal stakeholders to visualize&#xD;
    coming models or releases of&amp;nbsp;a product. It is also a high-level plan for the coming product models or releases,&#xD;
    because it explain which features or capabilities that the new versions or new replacement products will have and when&#xD;
    they might be available to the market.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The product roadmap scope might vary. It can cover a single product or several products in a product family,&#xD;
    including&amp;nbsp;their variants and releases. If the roadmap covers several product families or business units and&#xD;
    several years ahead, then&amp;nbsp;the roadmap is usually referred to as the &lt;em>strategic product roadmap&lt;/em>. The&#xD;
    strategic product roadmap is not the responsibility of a single product manager. Instead, it is handled by a product&#xD;
    development committee.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A product roadmap is used to provide internal and external stakeholders with the vision of the product's future&#xD;
    and&amp;nbsp;its possible destination. Therefore, it is best to communicate it at a high level. Otherwise, it could seem&#xD;
    that you promise to provide certain features at a certain date, which is not the intention of a roadmap. The&#xD;
    &lt;em>internal&lt;/em> roadmap can be described &lt;strong>in&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>more detail&lt;/strong>, such as quarterly;&#xD;
    whereas, the &lt;em>external&lt;/em> roadmap can be described &lt;strong>at a higher level&lt;/strong>, such as yearly. Make sure&#xD;
    to communicate the roadmap as a &lt;em>plan&lt;/em>, not a &lt;em>commitment&lt;/em>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also assume that the competition&amp;nbsp;might see&amp;nbsp;the roadmap. Therefore, do not include information that is&#xD;
    confidential to the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To convey to stakeholders what the plans are for products to be included in the portfolio.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
