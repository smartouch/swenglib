  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The technology roadmap is similar to the product roadmap, but rather than products, it lays out the technologies on a&#xD;
    time line and shows their sequential relationship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The technology roadmap is established or reviewed during technology planning activities&amp;nbsp;when the organization&#xD;
    focuses on identifying opportunities. The technologies (in some cases called &lt;em>platforms&lt;/em>) are the enablers of&#xD;
    the future products.&amp;nbsp;A given technology&amp;nbsp;is typically used in many products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;roadmap is an enabler for establishing consensus regarding identified needs and about which&#xD;
    technologies&amp;nbsp;should be used to meet those needs. This roadmap is also an aid in the technology forecasting effort,&#xD;
    and it is a framework that helps the organization to plan and coordinate technology development.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some companies combine their product roadmaps and&amp;nbsp;technology roadmaps to visualize dependencies between technology&#xD;
    development and product development.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To establish which technologies should be used to meet&amp;nbsp;product development&amp;nbsp;needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
