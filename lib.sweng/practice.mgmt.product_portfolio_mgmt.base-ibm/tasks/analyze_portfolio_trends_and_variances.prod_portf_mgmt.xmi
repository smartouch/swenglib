    From the composition of the product portfolio and the data sets available to the organization, select the subset of&#xD;
    analysis and trending techniques that best suits the needs of the portfolio stakeholders. As the product portfolio&#xD;
    management framework and the organizational readiness mature, you can add more advanced and complex techniques to the&#xD;
    portfolio analysis and trending needs.&#xD;

    Internal and external&amp;nbsp;conditions&amp;nbsp;within which the portfolio is being managed will change over time. This will&#xD;
    require additional analysis to understand possible impact and dependencies related to works in progress within the&#xD;
    portfolio.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Outside of the regular analysis and trends already referenced, conduct (as needed) simulation analysis, price&#xD;
    sensitivity analysis, what-if scenarios, and impact assessment to respond to internal and external changes to the&#xD;
    portfolio. For example, the entry of a new competitor or substantial advances on a competing infrastructure might pose&#xD;
    a serious risk to the existing product portfolio. This would require the elaboration of what-if scenarios to assess the&#xD;
    range of options that could restore the firm's competitive position and the potential impact of those if the&#xD;
    organization chooses to accelerate investments in its new products.&amp;nbsp;Such exercises would not be conducted at each&#xD;
    portfolio review, but would become critical in the event of a substantial change in competitive conditions.&#xD;
