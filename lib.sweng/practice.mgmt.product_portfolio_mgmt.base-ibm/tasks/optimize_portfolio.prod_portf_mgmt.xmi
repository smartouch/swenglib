    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand and represent, as currently as possible, all of the conditions under which work is executed and the&#xD;
    portfolio managed, so that the portfolio optimization can be performed in an effective manner. Update the portfolio&#xD;
    targets and metrics to reflect changes in conditions such as financial constraints and market conditions. These can&#xD;
    drive changes to the expected risk level, which can impact the portfolio risk tolerance, thresholds, and targets.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_LvFVYCk_Ed6Rd7kSe0dmSA" name="Develop or adapt portfolio analysis techniques and models" guid="_LvFVYCk_Ed6Rd7kSe0dmSA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Modify the analysis techniques used to optimize the portfolio, as needed, to reflect the&amp;nbsp;changes within the&#xD;
    portfolio environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a sudden change to market demand might create the need to introduce a probability analysis (such as&#xD;
    decision tree models) to support executive actions to temporarily divest a new platform, while understanding the impact&#xD;
    on commitments made to critical customers. Another common source of change is rapid increases in the number of criteria&#xD;
    needed to prioritize components, which might impact the design, structure, and weights of a scorecard.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common portfolio scenario&amp;nbsp;is to accommodate a reduction in funding for a given fiscal year, in which case some&#xD;
    work might be rescheduled for a following period.&amp;nbsp;Another common scenario is to accommodate changes in market&#xD;
    conditions and demands for a given product. Other scenarios to consider are&amp;nbsp;the entry of new competitors in the&#xD;
    market, potential withdrawal of an important supplier, and emergence of a new technology or platform. Any of those&#xD;
    changes can cause substantial reduction or increase in the expected profitability of a given product investment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand the changes in conditions that might impact the portfolio, and develop corrective actions or required&#xD;
    adjustments to the overall portfolio and its components to keep the balance of the portfolio optimal. Survey the&#xD;
    internal and external conditions of the portfolio to identify such potential or actual changes.&amp;nbsp;Develop a set of&#xD;
    recommendations and&amp;nbsp;submit them&amp;nbsp;to the portfolio stakeholders and review board for consideration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_OjYpACk_Ed6Rd7kSe0dmSA" name="Generate and communicate recommendations to the portfolio" guid="_OjYpACk_Ed6Rd7kSe0dmSA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make recommendations at the component level, for components to be approved, reprioritized or canceled. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Component A:&lt;/strong> Maintain as is&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Component B:&lt;/strong> Invest&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Component C:&lt;/strong> Retire&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also, make recommendations of suggested assignments and responsibilities for the work in each component. Update the&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;list of components&amp;nbsp;to reflect changes in priorities,&amp;nbsp;new components added,&amp;nbsp;components put on hold,&#xD;
    and so on. When the final recommendations are ready and documented in the required format, formally&#xD;
    communicate&amp;nbsp;those recommendations&amp;nbsp;to the portfolio stakeholders and review board&amp;nbsp;to ensure that all&#xD;
    decision-makers are basing their positions and actions on common and validated information.&#xD;
