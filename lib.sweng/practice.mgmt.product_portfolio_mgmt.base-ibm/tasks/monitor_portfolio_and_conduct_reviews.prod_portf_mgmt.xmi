    The various reviews conducted within the&amp;nbsp;portfolio monitoring and controlling&amp;nbsp;activity generate large amounts&#xD;
    of information. This needs to be consolidated and reported in a consistent and predictable manner for presentation to&#xD;
    the portfolio stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;step consists of producing the required standard reports and formats, servicing the needs of all&#xD;
    stakeholders, to ensure weekly data feeds into the monthly reviews, which in turn feed into the quarterly and yearly&#xD;
    reviews.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An important consideration for the specific information related to risks, issues, and change requests is that each&#xD;
    level of management (team leads, project or product managers, and portfolio executives) has an associated degree of&#xD;
    authority and accountability over factors that can directly affect the outcomes and objectives of the work being&#xD;
    executed within the portfolio.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is common that thresholds based on severity and impact&amp;nbsp;are used to determine which level of management is&#xD;
    required to respond to a risk, issue, or change request.&amp;nbsp;The application of those thresholds will determine which&#xD;
    of the weekly, monthly, or quarterly cycles will dispose of the various risks, issues and change requests.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on the severity and urgency of the scenarios identified as part of the analyzing portfolio trends and variances,&#xD;
    select the components that require executive action that respond best to the changes within the portfolio.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify any required changes to portfolio component priorities and composition to prepare recommendations that will&#xD;
    help portfolio executives make decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, given a change to the competitive landscape resulting from the entry of a new competitor, this task&#xD;
    identifies the specific set of components that need adjustments (such as adding, removing, or changing priority),&#xD;
    elaborates on the desired impact on the overall portfolio, and highlights the specific actions or decisions requested&#xD;
    from the portfolio executives and review board.&#xD;
