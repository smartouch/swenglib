    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,
    implementation, and deployment.
&lt;/p>

    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various

    This role works closely with&amp;nbsp;project managers&amp;nbsp;in staffing and planning the project, because it is recommended
    that the team be organized around the architecture.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate results and actions from
    assessments.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Work Items should contain estimates. See guidelines on managing work items and agile estimation.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        System-wide requirements
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Changes and enhancement requests
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Defects
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Development tasks
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is
    inaccessible?
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.

    &lt;li>
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.

        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>         When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs
of all of the stakeholders are represented. In         particular, include
the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system
after it is delivered.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide
requirements and other requirements work         products. For example, the
authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements
within system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important
requirements are missed or duplicated, and that there is an agreed upon approach
for capturing and processing every type of requirement.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting
the source of the requirement is particularly         important when you separate
externally mandated requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying
a quality or desirable characteristic) versus         &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying
a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative
requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either
through testing or some other objective evaluation.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule
impact, and level of contribution to business goals.         Based on your
evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged,
defended, and amended.     &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service
    portfolio or service model.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Points to consider when deciding whether to use a Component Model:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A Component Model is useful when you must design the system for multiple target environments, with separate design&#xD;
        architectures. The Component Model is an abstraction, or a generalization, of the system design. It omits most of&#xD;
        the details of the design in order to provide an overview of the system's functionality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Component Model provides value when the design is complex, such that new team members need a simplified,&#xD;
        abstracted model to understand it. A well-defined architecture can serve the same purpose.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Balance the extra work required to ensure that the component and design models remain consistent against the&#xD;
        benefit of having a view of the system that represents only the most important details of how the system works. It&#xD;
        can be very costly to maintain a high degree of fidelity between the Component Model and the system design. A less&#xD;
        ambitious approach might be to maintain the Component Model with only the most important components and the key&#xD;
        abstractions in the design. As the complexity of the Component Model increases, so does the cost to maintain it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Once you no longer maintain the Component Model, its value decays rapidly. At some point, it no longer accurately&#xD;
        reflects the current functional design of the system. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Model may be&#xD;
        appropriate, as it may have served its purpose, but the decision should be a conscious one.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many variants of the&#xD;
    system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure the successful development of a component model on a project, your team should:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a stable and coherent structure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focus on the right levels of abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop relationship and interaction diagrams in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select architecturally significant requirements as inputs to the Component Model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plan how your team will leverage the Component Model throughout the project lifecycle&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The component model describes the structure of a system in terms of its software components with their&#xD;
    responsibilities, interfaces, relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required functionality. The&#xD;
    component model is the main artifact documenting the functional view of the architecture and serves as an abstraction&#xD;
    of the design. Components identified may be decomposed into further component models before they complete the&#xD;
    specification required for detailed design.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models help define and document:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The structure of the system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The recurring interactions and dependencies between sets of components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The components present within an enterprise, each of which may be made up of smaller components.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models are documented at 2 levels:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The logical level - focuses on specifying the components' responsibilities and characteristics required to deliver&#xD;
        the requirements. These specifications are technology and product neutral.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The physical level -focuses on how to implement the components to meet the previously established specifications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may transform logical components into physical components via custom development, the purchase of products, or the&#xD;
    reuse of assets.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important to maintain a separation between logical and physical components on larger projects. However,&#xD;
    smaller or less complex projects may evolve a single logical component model into a physical model, and end up with&#xD;
    only a physical model.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of components at the logical level are a 'Message Bus' or a 'Customer Relationship Manager' component.&#xD;
    Components at the physical level that implement these logical components might be 'IBM WebSphere Message Broker' or&#xD;
    'Siebel Contact Center.'&lt;br />&#xD;

    variants of the system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact specifies the details of a component identified in the Component Model. The specification shows the&#xD;
    interfaces offered and used by the component, identifies where business rules are placed, and details the operations&#xD;
    and their signatures for each interface.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Component Interfaces&lt;/strong> - An interface specifies one or more operation signatures and is both offered and&#xD;
    used by a component. Offering an interface means the component makes the interface available for other components to&#xD;
    use.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each interface provides a unique and well-defined set of operations. Hiding the structure of a&#xD;
    component and its data behind an interface allows that data to be changed without affecting how the interface is&#xD;
    used.&amp;nbsp; The actual composition of that data may change, but the interface that provides access to that data is&#xD;
    fixed. Interfaces also describe the state of a component.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Business Rules&lt;/strong> - Business Rules dictate the behavior of a system, and the component specification&#xD;
    defines how the system implements the business rules.&amp;nbsp; For example, a business rule may state that Internet&#xD;
    transactions for an on-line order can not exceed $1000 for a given account. A component that manages account&#xD;
    transactions may define an on-line transactions interface that implements this business rule.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Operations&lt;/strong> - Fully specified Component Specifications assign operations and operation signatures to&#xD;
    the interfaces and may define pre- and post-conditions on the operations.&amp;nbsp; Pre- and post-conditions specify the&#xD;
    effect of an operation without prescribing an algorithm or implementation.&amp;nbsp;A post-condition specifies the effect&#xD;
    of the operation on the components data or state.&amp;nbsp;A pre-condition is the condition under which the operation&#xD;
    guarantees that the post-condition is true.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some important considerations for making and implementing architectural decisions:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure the process for making decisions has the right level of sponsorship necessary to enforce those decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make architecturally significant decisions early and be sure to validate high risk decisions using an executable&#xD;
        architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review and update architectural decisions as development progresses and update this artifact so it reflects any&#xD;
        changes to your decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is not necessary to document every minute decision you make when developing the architecture; focus on those&#xD;
        that are controversial or are based on reasoning that is not obvious&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>

    Levels of this artifact&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best&#xD;
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take&#xD;
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle&#xD;
    and the development techniques used.&amp;nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>logical&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>physical&lt;/strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,&#xD;
    iterative, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed&#xD;
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project &quot;milestone&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Varying depth of detail&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing&#xD;
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed&#xD;
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may include the same &quot;recurring pattern&quot; of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate&#xD;
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Cross-cutting viewpoints&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact and the logical and physical levels of this artifact may be the focus of a particular viewpoint, at any&#xD;
    degree of elaboration and refinement, to address the concerns of a particular stakeholder. These cross-cutting&#xD;
    viewpoints overlap with one another.&amp;nbsp; For example, views may be constructed on this artifact for:&#xD;

    Linkages to other work products&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well as a linkage via Deployment Units with the functional aspect of architecture as embodied in the Component&#xD;
    Model, this artifact has influences and/or is strongly interdependent on other areas that cover the design of the&#xD;
    infrastructure that will implement the operational aspect of architecture. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Network Design: affects the application design, middleware selection, component placement, security and privacy,&#xD;
        systems management and overall operational system control.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Platform Design; the detailed design and configuration of the platforms that will implement the nodes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Storage Design; the detailed design and configuration of storage which may be shared across multiple platforms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Site &amp;amp; Facilities Design; the detailed design and configuration of the site and facilities in the locations in&#xD;
        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what&#xD;
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&amp;nbsp; Selection of a systems management style&#xD;
        is an important decision, which determines: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of operations management&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of software distribution&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The complexity of system management tooling&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Potential security and performance of the IT system (ability to satisfy the service level requirements)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Existing or planned enterprise-wide IT infrastructure initiatives on which the target system will be&#xD;
        implemented.&amp;nbsp; For example, enterprise wide middleware decisions may well move function, which would otherwise&#xD;
        be duplicated across multiple applications, into a set of shared services, which are usually purchased or part of&#xD;
        an enterprise wide development effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment&#xD;
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to&#xD;
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional&#xD;
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Operational Modeling Terminology&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3&#xD;
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actors (and workers) - the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Locations - a geographical area or position.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Borders - representing the existing connection between two locations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment Units - a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connectors - enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interactions - identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a&#xD;
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within&#xD;
        the target system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Zones - an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular&#xD;
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic&#xD;
        between two model elements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect&#xD;
        of the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology independent and product neutral&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Physical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of&#xD;
        the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology and product dependent&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the&#xD;
    level has been sized:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Unsized&lt;/strong> (or unranged) - the technology and products are specified to support the components&#xD;
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Ranged&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for&#xD;
        a defined range of circumstances.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Sized&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and&#xD;
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>The most important thing about coding guidelines is to have them. Everyone has their stylistic preferences, but a enforcing&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Code analysis guidelines includes information for the static and runtime evaluation of the implementation (code).&#xD;
    Static guidelines focus on code that is not currently running. Dynamic guidelines focus on evaluating the behavior of&#xD;
    the software as the code is executing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Static analysis includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Coding guidelines that give the implementation a familiar look and feel to everyone on the team, and make it easier&#xD;
        to find code blocks and commonly used areas of code (methods, case statements, etc). These guidelines makes the&#xD;
        code more maintainable and more efficient to produce.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Code dependency that evaluates how different implementation modules depend upon each other. This can improve&#xD;
        coupling and cohesion at the implementation level, for example.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Code complexity that helps developers judge if the code has become too complex to be maintained efficiently.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most of the Developer Tests are created in the same timeframe as the software components that need to be tested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entire suite of developer tests should be run often to reduce the number of regression errors introduced during&#xD;
    implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a
    particular aspect of a scenario.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as
    specified.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has
    run correctly.

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate results and actions from
    assessments.

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        System-wide requirements

    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Development tasks
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The end of a phase represents a point of synchronization (of technical and management expectations) and closure for a&#xD;
    project, and it coincides (more or less) with the end of an iteration. However, unlike other iterations, the iteration&#xD;
    that terminates a phase should leave few loose ends and issues to be carried forward into the next iteration (which&#xD;
    will be in the next phase). Indeed, phase ends mark a point at which it is possible to consider re-scoping and even&#xD;
    re-contracting a project. For example, the inception phase is exploratory and may be appropriately performed under a&#xD;
    time-and-materials or cost-plus type of contract. The elaboration phase could be done as a fixed-price or cost-plus&#xD;
    contract, depending on the degree of novelty of the development. Enough is known about the system by the construction&#xD;
    and transition phases that fixed-price contracts are more appealing to acquirer and vendor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The phase end is marked by a major milestone, at which a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.extend-ibm/tasks/lifecycle_milestone_review_B4D90641.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{E611CCFD-E4C5-408E-9B0E-46B2A3D01290}&quot;>Lifecycle Milestone Review&lt;/a> is conducted. This is intended to achieve&#xD;
    concurrence among all stakeholders on the current state of the project. These reviews are usually formal and are&#xD;
    conducted with some ceremony, to demonstrate to all stakeholders that the aims of the phase were achieved. The end of&#xD;
    the transition phase is marked by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/product_release_8BCA935E.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Pwn0ACVxEdqSZ9OimJ-AzA&quot;>Product Release Milestone&lt;/a>. Also &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager will have planned, going into the final iteration of the phase, to have all required work products&#xD;
    ready for the Lifecycle Milestone Review. However, assess the iteration before the Lifecycle Milestone Review is held.&#xD;
    If the iteration has gone well, there will be little to do to prepare for phase close-out other than distributing&#xD;
    phase-end work products to stakeholders. The project manager may decide that certain issues arising from the Iteration&#xD;
    Assessment or issues remaining in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.extend-ibm/workproducts/issues_list_40ACA7DC.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{78157368-E2D1-457E-84AF-D8D2C1C20B97}&quot;>Issues List&lt;/a> need to be addressed before the Lifecycle Milestone&#xD;
    review, and cannot be carried over into the next phase. This means that, in effect, a micro-iteration will occur, in&#xD;
    which selected problems will be fixed and issues resolved, although in terms of workflow, this can be considered an&#xD;
    extension of the final iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Lifecycle Milestone Review is held at the conclusion of each phase to determine, following the completion of the&#xD;
    final iteration of the phase, whether the project should be allowed to proceed to the next phase. It marks a point at&#xD;
    which management and technical expectations should be resynchronized, but the issues to be considered should relate&#xD;
    mainly to the management of the project - major technical issues should have been resolved with the final iteration (of&#xD;
    the phase).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate results and actions from
    assessments.

    This list should capture the critical and serious risks. If you find this list extending beyond 20 items, carefully consider

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        System-wide requirements
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Changes and enhancement requests
    &lt;/li>

        Defects
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Development tasks
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Package Design Documentation
    &lt;/li>

    &lt;li>
        Interface Specifications
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is
    inaccessible?
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The User Support Specifications should cover:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The reports and interfaces that have been developed, and
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The specifications define the boundaries between the different units of user documentation, as well as:

    &lt;li>
        Content

  to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders 
  can clearly see that terms are being used consistently. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether 
  to have all terms in a single glossary or to maintain terms in several glossaries, 
  business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple places, 
  you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take 
  precedence. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing 
  broader glossaries, business terms artifacts, or data models, where they exist.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>         When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs
of all of the stakeholders are represented. In         particular, include
the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system
after it is delivered.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide
requirements and other requirements work         products. For example, the
authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements
within system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important
requirements are missed or duplicated, and that there is an agreed upon approach
for capturing and processing every type of requirement.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting
the source of the requirement is particularly         important when you separate
externally mandated requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying
a quality or desirable characteristic) versus         &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying
a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative
requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either
through testing or some other objective evaluation.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule
impact, and level of contribution to business goals.         Based on your
evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged,
defended, and amended.     &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;artifact concentrates on the classes of person and other systems that interact with the system under&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service
    portfolio or service model.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;

    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Points to consider when deciding whether to use a Component Model:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A Component Model is useful when you must design the system for multiple target environments, with separate design&#xD;
        architectures. The Component Model is an abstraction, or a generalization, of the system design. It omits most of&#xD;
        the details of the design in order to provide an overview of the system's functionality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Component Model provides value when the design is complex, such that new team members need a simplified,&#xD;
        abstracted model to understand it. A well-defined architecture can serve the same purpose.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Balance the extra work required to ensure that the component and design models remain consistent against the&#xD;
        benefit of having a view of the system that represents only the most important details of how the system works. It&#xD;
        can be very costly to maintain a high degree of fidelity between the Component Model and the system design. A less&#xD;
        ambitious approach might be to maintain the Component Model with only the most important components and the key&#xD;
        abstractions in the design. As the complexity of the Component Model increases, so does the cost to maintain it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Once you no longer maintain the Component Model, its value decays rapidly. At some point, it no longer accurately&#xD;
        reflects the current functional design of the system. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Model may be&#xD;
        appropriate, as it may have served its purpose, but the decision should be a conscious one.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many variants of the&#xD;
    system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure the successful development of a component model on a project, your team should:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a stable and coherent structure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focus on the right levels of abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop relationship and interaction diagrams in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select architecturally significant requirements as inputs to the Component Model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plan how your team will leverage the Component Model throughout the project lifecycle&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The component model describes the structure of a system in terms of its software components with their&#xD;
    responsibilities, interfaces, relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required functionality. The&#xD;
    component model is the main artifact documenting the functional view of the architecture and serves as an abstraction&#xD;
    of the design. Components identified may be decomposed into further component models before they complete the&#xD;
    specification required for detailed design.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models help define and document:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The structure of the system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The recurring interactions and dependencies between sets of components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The components present within an enterprise, each of which may be made up of smaller components.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models are documented at 2 levels:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The logical level - focuses on specifying the components' responsibilities and characteristics required to deliver&#xD;
        the requirements. These specifications are technology and product neutral.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The physical level -focuses on how to implement the components to meet the previously established specifications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may transform logical components into physical components via custom development, the purchase of products, or the&#xD;
    reuse of assets.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important to maintain a separation between logical and physical components on larger projects. However,&#xD;
    smaller or less complex projects may evolve a single logical component model into a physical model, and end up with&#xD;
    only a physical model.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of components at the logical level are a 'Message Bus' or a 'Customer Relationship Manager' component.&#xD;
    Components at the physical level that implement these logical components might be 'IBM WebSphere Message Broker' or&#xD;
    'Siebel Contact Center.'&lt;br />&#xD;

    Component Specifications tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many&#xD;
    variants of the system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact specifies the details of a component identified in the Component Model. The specification shows the&#xD;
    interfaces offered and used by the component, identifies where business rules are placed, and details the operations&#xD;
    and their signatures for each interface.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Component Interfaces&lt;/strong> - An interface specifies one or more operation signatures and is both offered and&#xD;
    used by a component. Offering an interface means the component makes the interface available for other components to&#xD;
    use.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each interface provides a unique and well-defined set of operations. Hiding the structure of a&#xD;
    component and its data behind an interface allows that data to be changed without affecting how the interface is&#xD;
    used.&amp;nbsp; The actual composition of that data may change, but the interface that provides access to that data is&#xD;
    fixed. Interfaces also describe the state of a component.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Business Rules&lt;/strong> - Business Rules dictate the behavior of a system, and the component specification&#xD;
    defines how the system implements the business rules.&amp;nbsp; For example, a business rule may state that Internet&#xD;
    transactions for an on-line order can not exceed $1000 for a given account. A component that manages account&#xD;
    transactions may define an on-line transactions interface that implements this business rule.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Operations&lt;/strong> - Fully specified Component Specifications assign operations and operation signatures to&#xD;
    the interfaces and may define pre- and post-conditions on the operations.&amp;nbsp; Pre- and post-conditions specify the&#xD;
    effect of an operation without prescribing an algorithm or implementation.&amp;nbsp;A post-condition specifies the effect&#xD;
    of the operation on the components data or state.&amp;nbsp;A pre-condition is the condition under which the operation&#xD;
    guarantees that the post-condition is true.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some important considerations for making and implementing architectural decisions:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure the process for making decisions has the right level of sponsorship necessary to enforce those decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make architecturally significant decisions early and be sure to validate high risk decisions using an executable&#xD;
        architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review and update architectural decisions as development progresses and update this artifact so it reflects any&#xD;
        changes to your decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is not necessary to document every minute decision you make when developing the architecture; focus on those&#xD;
        that are controversial or are based on reasoning that is not obvious&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Levels of this artifact&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best&#xD;
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take&#xD;
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle&#xD;
    and the development techniques used.&amp;nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>logical&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>physical&lt;/strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,&#xD;
    iterative, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed&#xD;
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project &quot;milestone&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Varying depth of detail&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing&#xD;
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed&#xD;
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may include the same &quot;recurring pattern&quot; of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate&#xD;
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.&#xD;

        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what&#xD;
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&amp;nbsp; Selection of a systems management style&#xD;
        is an important decision, which determines: &#xD;

    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment&#xD;
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to&#xD;
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional&#xD;
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3&#xD;
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actors (and workers) - the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Locations - a geographical area or position.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Borders - representing the existing connection between two locations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment Units - a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connectors - enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interactions - identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a&#xD;
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within&#xD;
        the target system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Zones - an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular&#xD;
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic&#xD;
        between two model elements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect&#xD;
        of the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology independent and product neutral&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Physical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of&#xD;
        the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology and product dependent&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the&#xD;
    level has been sized:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Unsized&lt;/strong> (or unranged) - the technology and products are specified to support the components&#xD;
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Ranged&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for&#xD;
        a defined range of circumstances.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Sized&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and&#xD;
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>The most important thing about coding guidelines is to have them. Everyone has their stylistic preferences, but a enforcing&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Code analysis guidelines includes information for the static and runtime evaluation of the implementation (code).&#xD;
    Static guidelines focus on code that is not currently running. Dynamic guidelines focus on evaluating the behavior of&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Static analysis includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Coding guidelines that give the implementation a familiar look and feel to everyone on the team, and make it easier&#xD;
        to find code blocks and commonly used areas of code (methods, case statements, etc). These guidelines makes the&#xD;
        code more maintainable and more efficient to produce.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Code dependency that evaluates how different implementation modules depend upon each other. This can improve&#xD;
        coupling and cohesion at the implementation level, for example.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most of the Developer Tests are created in the same timeframe as the software components that need to be tested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entire suite of developer tests should be run often to reduce the number of regression errors introduced during&#xD;
    implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developer tests are often shared with integration and system testing organizations so regression tests can be run on&#xD;
    the integrated system.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a
    particular aspect of a scenario.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as
    specified.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.

Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.

    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    <refinedDescription>For a commercial software product, the Business Case should include a set of assumptions about the project and the order of&#xD;
magnitude return on investment (ROI) if those assumptions are true. For example, the ROI will be a magnitude of five if&#xD;
completed in one year, two if completed in two years, and a negative number after that. These assumptions are checked again&#xD;
at the end of the Elaboration phase, when the scope and plan are defined with more accuracy.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the objectives of the process is to ensure that the expectations of all parties are synchronized and consistent.&#xD;
    The periodic Status Assessment provides a mechanism for managing everyone's expectations throughout the project&#xD;
    lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuous open communication with objective data derived directly from ongoing activities and the evolving product&#xD;
    configurations are mandatory in any project. These project snapshots provide the basis for management's attention.&#xD;
    While the period may vary, the forcing function needs to capture the project history.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that Status Assessments are different from milestone reviews.&#xD;
