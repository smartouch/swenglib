  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The format and contents of the Project Measurements&amp;nbsp;depends on the metrics selected and the technology used for&#xD;
    collection and storage. It is essentially a database of metric-value associations and allied information for their&#xD;
    collection and calculation. Its form could be as simple as a set of files manually maintained by the Project&#xD;
    Manager.&amp;nbsp; However, we recommend that the collection and storage be automated and, as far as possible, be made&#xD;
    non-intrusive.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Measurements work product provides the storage for the project's metrics data. It is kept current as&#xD;
    measurements are made or become available. It also contains the derived metrics that are calculated from the primitive&#xD;
    data and should also store information (procedures and algorithms, for example) about how the derived metrics are&#xD;
    obtained. Reports on the status of the project, for example, progress towards goals (functionality, quality, and so&#xD;
    on), expenditures, and other resource consumption, are produced using the project measurements (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.extend-ibm/workproducts/status_assessment_A990B5EF.html&quot; guid=&quot;{F6D674A6-D71A-4D36-A195-4C888C1D0E70}&quot;>Artifact: Status Assessment&lt;/a>). More frequent, or even apparently&#xD;
    continuous, displays of project status are possible using tools where automated software data collection agents feed&#xD;
    real-time displays of project status.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    On smaller projects, project measurements may exist only as reports from the defect tracking system and a spreadsheet&#xD;
    to track progress. On larger or more formal projects, there may be a large selection of metrics managed using one or&#xD;
    more databases. This may be a distributed work product.&amp;nbsp; For example, the various metrics selected by the Project&#xD;
    Manager may be produced by several different tools, with the collection and reporting task being a manual&#xD;
    one.&amp;nbsp;Another example: the project's progress may be reported from a project plan that is routinely updated by the&#xD;
    Project Manager from status information supplied in spreadsheets by team members.&#xD;
