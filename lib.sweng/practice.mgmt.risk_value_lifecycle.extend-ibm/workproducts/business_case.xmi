  <mainDescription>For a commercial software product, the Business Case should include a set of assumptions about the project and the order of&#xD;
magnitude return on investment (ROI) if those assumptions are true. For example, the ROI will be a magnitude of five if&#xD;
completed in one year, two if completed in two years, and a negative number after that. These assumptions are checked again&#xD;
at the end of the Elaboration phase, when the scope and plan are defined with more accuracy.</mainDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main purpose of the Business Case is to develop an economic plan for realizing the project vision presented in the&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Vision&lt;/a>. Once developed, the Business Case is used to make an accurate assessment of&#xD;
    the return on investment (ROI) provided by the project. It provides the justification for the project and establishes&#xD;
    its economic constraints. It provides information to the economic decision makers on the project's economic worth and&#xD;
    is used to determine whether the project should move ahead.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At critical milestones, the Business Case is re-examined to see if estimates of expected return and cost are still&#xD;
    accurate, and whether the project should be continued.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The form and depth of analysis required for this work product depends on the level of investment required for the&#xD;
    project. The requirement for high levels of investment will demand a very formal, well researched and well founded&#xD;
    Business Case. The greater the amount of investment, the more estimates will be challenged by senior management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the case of a project performed under contract (as a result of a bid award, for example), the Request for Proposal,&#xD;
    the response, and the subsequent contract together form the Business Case.&#xD;
