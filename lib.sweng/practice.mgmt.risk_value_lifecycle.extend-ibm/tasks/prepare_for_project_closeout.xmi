    that there remain no problems that will preclude formal acceptance, and that any issues that do remain are documented&#xD;
    and handed over for resolution to the customer or other maintenance organization.

    installation and training, have been completed according to the contract and its supporting plans. If the customer does&#xD;
    not give this acceptance, then there may have to be another iteration to resolve the issues that block acceptance.&#xD;

    understood and have an owner in the support and maintenance organization. If there was a formal acceptance test, the&#xD;
    status of results and corrective actions should be reviewed, to ensure there are no showstoppers going into the formal&#xD;
    Project Acceptance Review. The state of&amp;nbsp;the deployment&amp;nbsp;activities should be examined to ensure that&#xD;

    Handle&amp;nbsp;the remaining administrative tasks of project termination. These typically include the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Ensuring that the project is formally accepted: the contract and/or product acceptance plans will describe the&#xD;
            requirements. In the end, what is needed, in effect, is signed agreement from the customer that all contracted&#xD;
            deliveries have been made, meet the contracted requirements and are accepted into ownership by the customer;&#xD;
            all contracted tasks (including acceptance test, if any) have been successfully completed; and that the&#xD;
            customer takes all further responsibility (warranty and latent defect claims aside), for the products and any&#xD;
            residual issues and actions associated with them.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Settling the project's finances - making sure all payments have been received and all suppliers and&#xD;
            subcontractors paid. Organizational policy or other regulatory requirement may also require a more formal audit&#xD;
            process at project termination, covering the project's finances, budgeting process, and assets.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Archiving all project documentation and records.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Transferring any remaining (non-deliverable) hardware and environment assets to the owning organization's pool&#xD;
            of assets.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Transfer the project measurements to the corporate historical database.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Reassign remaining project staff: if possible, this should not be done abruptly. Most projects can accommodate&#xD;
            a gradual ramp-down of staff levels, and allow a smoother transition of staff to other projects. The project&#xD;
            manager should ensure that the project knowledge and responsibilities of departing staff have been transferred&#xD;
            to those remaining. Staff performance reviews should also be conducted as staff are transferred.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />&#xD;
