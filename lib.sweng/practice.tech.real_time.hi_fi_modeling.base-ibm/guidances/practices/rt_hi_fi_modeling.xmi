  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The High-Fidelity Modeling (also known as High Fidelity Model-Based Engineering or HiMBE) practice provides a workflow&#xD;
    for creating and managing models, primarily in UML and SysML, that precisely describe the abstractions under&#xD;
    consideration. HiMBE is used to create requirements models (Computationally Independent Models (CIMs) in MDA terms),&#xD;
    object analysis models (Platform Independent Models or PIMs) in MDA terms) or design models (Platform Specific Models&#xD;
    or PSMs in MDA terms).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In all cases, the goal is to create a model that is specified to enough detail and fidelity to support execution, test,&#xD;
    and (in the case of PIMs and PSMs) code generation. The benefits of these models greatly outweighs their costs.&#xD;
    Although some practitioners advocate low fidelity (also known as &quot;napkin&quot;) models, these have been found in practice to&#xD;
    add minimal value, since they are merely notional and not testable. HiMBE models, however, can be demonstrated,&#xD;
    debugged, and tested so their accuracy and fidelity can be assured early in the development process.&#xD;
