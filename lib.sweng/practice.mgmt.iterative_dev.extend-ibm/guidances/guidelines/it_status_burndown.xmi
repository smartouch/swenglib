    Status reporting states where the project is in relation to the business goals, project plan, and implementation&#xD;
    schedule. The quality of the implemented functionality to date is also tracked but may not be required as a status&#xD;
    item, yet it might be very useful in decision making. There are different perspectives of status reporting in a&#xD;
    software development project: the internal and external perspectives, as detailed on the next sections.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Internal Perspective&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This perspective is the development team's view of the project state. As the team moves through an iteration, weekly or&#xD;
    daily status meetings allow the team to identify the functionality implemented. This perspective provides the lowest&#xD;
    level of status reporting and tracking. The cumulative amount of implemented functionality provides a trend of project&#xD;
    performance. Visually representing a cumulative amount shows a development team where they are in relation to the total&#xD;
    amount of functionality needed implemented by the end of the project with the appropriate level of quality, that is, a&#xD;
    successful project to the development team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Presenting this in a burndown chart quickly provides the team a view of their progress. Seeing the trend promotes&#xD;
    discussion among the development team to identify corrective action and gain commitment on the recommendations for&#xD;
    improving project performance. The following charts represent a project in the third iteration with an overall length&#xD;
    of eight iterations. Chart A depicts how much functionality has been implemented to date from the total functionality&#xD;
    that was to be implemented at the beginning of the project. Chart B adds a trend line to show that if the team&#xD;
    continues to perform at the continued rate they should be confident they will successfully complete their project and&#xD;
    implement all functionality, potentially earlier than the scheduled eight iterations. There was significant improvement&#xD;
    between iteration two and three. This improvement could mean either of two things: the most difficult and complex&#xD;
    functionality had been implemented by iteration 3 or the team took the action to make changes resulting in improved&#xD;
    project performance.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

                &lt;/p>&#xD;
            &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Chart C represents a project that appears in bad shape. However, appearances may prove deceiving. This could also be&#xD;
    representative of a project that expected to take at least four iterations to implement the most difficult, complex&#xD;
    functionality. In that case, iteration five would see a significant improvement. Or, this project may have attempted to&#xD;
    take corrective actions in the second iteration but either they were ineffective or additional roadblocks appeared.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development team members need to share their progress and identify issues they are facing, resulting in a list that&#xD;
    is frequently reviewed to insure timely closure of individual issues. A growing list of action items with no&#xD;
    resolutions indicates an unhealthy project environment. If project teams do not make progress with the implementation&#xD;
    of functionality, it might imply projects destined to exceed budget and schedule. Decision makers need to be careful&#xD;
    not to jump to conclusions too soon. In the example, work performed in iteration 4 and beyond could be less complex.&#xD;
    That being the case, it would be expected that productivity would drastically increase in iteration 4. This level of&#xD;
    information should be reflected in the project plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

            &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    External Perspective&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This perspective provides business stakeholders (department heads, directors, etc.) outside of the project development&#xD;
    team with visibility into the state of the project. This visibility is necessary in order to gauge performance towards&#xD;
    the achievement of business goals and the achievement of planned payback schedule or Return on Investment (ROI). The&#xD;
    informational elements providing this external perspective of the state of the project are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The cumulative amount of functionality that has been implemented.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The amount of functionality yet to be implemented.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The amount of budget that has been consumed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The amount of schedule that has been consumed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Key issues affecting project performance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Recommendations for project improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Providing management with a view into the amount of functionality implemented enables decision makers of the program or&#xD;
    portfolio with an understanding of project performance. From a business point of view, a successful project will:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform to plan.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provide the requested business functionality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Achieve the planned payback or ROI.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The need for this visibility provides decision makers with timely information necessary to either:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the project to continue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Help improve the state of the project through reduction in scope and its ramifications to the business goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Introduce a project-level change request to increase the budget and extend the schedule.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cancel the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Presenting a visual representation of the budget consumed, for example, with a trend line over three iterations (burn&#xD;
    rate) quickly points out whether or not a project is healthy, as shown in Chart D. However, budget consumption by&#xD;
    itself needs to be viewed in light of the amount of functionality that has been implemented to date. Chart E represents&#xD;
    the display of both budget consumption and the amount of functionality implemented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            &lt;img height=&quot;341&quot; alt=&quot;Chart representing the budget consumed (burn rate)&quot; src=&quot;resources/chart_d.jpg&quot;             width=&quot;507&quot; />&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;p>&#xD;
                &lt;em>Chart D - Trend of budget consumed (burn rate) throughout the iterations&lt;/em>&#xD;
            &lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            &lt;img height=&quot;344&quot; alt=&quot;Chart representing the budget consumption and amount of functionality implemented&quot;             src=&quot;resources/chart_e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;513&quot; />&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;p>&#xD;
                &lt;em>Chart E - Budget consumption and amount of functionality implemented&lt;/em>&#xD;
            &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Charting the budget expenditures in this manner quickly informs the business stakeholders, without much dialog, that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Budget is being consumed at a much faster rate than estimated&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At the current rate of consumption, the originally allocated budget will not be sufficient to complete the&#xD;
        implementation of the remaining&amp;nbsp;functionality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to visual representations, key issues affecting the project - along with recommendations for improving the&#xD;
    state of the project - need to be presented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some organizations set aside special meetings with the business stakeholders for project managers to quickly present&#xD;
    project status. Providing visual representations reduces the need for excessive dialog, thus reducing the amount of&#xD;
    time required for the presentations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Presenting status information in a dashboard significantly cuts down the amount of time anyone needs to devote to&#xD;
    status meetings with business stakeholders. These status meetings may only be necessary for projects that need to&#xD;
    address questions like:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the cause for exceeding the burn rate?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the cause for not developing the expected functionality according to plan?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is the project creating too much risk for the business?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the plans for getting back on track?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How close to the original estimates will the project deliver?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What useful functionality can be delivered to the business if scope is reduced?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What payback will be received with scope reduction?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Will the business begin realizing the reduced payback sooner?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
