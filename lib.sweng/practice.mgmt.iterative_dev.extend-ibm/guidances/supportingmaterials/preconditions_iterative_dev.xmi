  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review these preconditions for the adoption of iterative development. If these conditions are not met, the risk of&#xD;
    undertaking an iterative development approach might be unacceptably high. In that spirit, one should not attempt&#xD;
    iterative development without the preconditions described below being in place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Full-time access to the required business expertise and decision-making&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, the business experts and decision-makers are part of the team and are colocated with the team. Pragmatically,&#xD;
    in large organizations, these professionals&amp;nbsp;can be available remotely (by phone, e-mail or other messaging&#xD;
    protocols), as long as they make a commitment to provide an extremely timely response.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Team made of generalizing specialists&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team members can cover all software development disciplines needed for the iteration and can each be fully engaged&#xD;
    throughout the iteration in work that contributes to the success of the iteration.&amp;nbsp;Ideally, this implies each team&#xD;
    member has an area of specialty, but can take on multiple roles, in line with the concept of generalizing specialists&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#AMB03&quot; guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[AMB03]&lt;/a>. Pragmatically, in large organizations where business and technical skills&#xD;
    are sometimes more segregated, it is possible to have a team in which some members do not program, as long as those&#xD;
    individuals can still take on multiple roles during the iteration.&amp;nbsp;For example, in a large organization, a&#xD;
    business analyst might also work on testing or creating user manuals during an iteration, with the understanding that a&#xD;
    separation of duties will still be maintained where needed; the analyst will only test portions of the iteration for&#xD;
    which he or she was not the primary analyst.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Management is willing to adopt best practices for planning and allocating resources to iterations&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, if management is open to adopting best practices for iterations and allocating resources for them, it implies&#xD;
    that, at the end of each iteration, management will ask for detailed plans and exact resource needs solely for the next&#xD;
    iteration and a rough forecast for future iterations, recognizing that plans and resource allocations will become more&#xD;
    predictable as the project moves into its later iterations. In large organizations, the driving force for needing&#xD;
    detailed plans is often the need to plan for and allocate highly specialized resources. With that in mind, one way to&#xD;
    reduce the need for detailed iteration plans beyond &quot;the next iteration&quot; is to reduce the need to assign highly&#xD;
    specialized resources to specific projects.&amp;nbsp;By choosing competent team members who can take on multiple roles and&#xD;
    who can work with limited direction from the highly specialized resources, the specialized resources can be leveraged&#xD;
    across multiple projects as mentors rather than as individual team members.&amp;nbsp;This, in turn, reduces the need to&#xD;
    schedule projects based on resource availability, and it also helps grow resource skills in the organization at the&#xD;
    same time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Teams have access to as much automation as possible for implementation and testing&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, this means that continuous integration and automated testing are an integral part of the software development&#xD;
    process.&amp;nbsp;Pragmatically, iterations can be undertaken with intense version management and configuration management&#xD;
    practices, but it is not easy, especially in a large organization where there are interproduct compatibility concerns.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Support for remote collaboration&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Distributed teams using iterative development must have access to the best possible support for remote collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At a minimum, distributed teams working with time-boxed iterations need the following conditions to be met:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Clear and crisp audio conferencing capabilities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reliable Web conferencing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remote access to automated version management and configuration management support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remote access to any documentation generated by the team (user stories, use cases, models)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, distributed teams will also have additional support for time-boxed iterations, by having the following access:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remote access to automated continuous integration and testing tools&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remote access to collaboration tools, such as those that provide discussion threads&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
