    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Iterative development is a team sport. It is that simple. As with any team sport, one player will not &quot;save the day&quot; if&#xD;
    the team members, the coach, and the owners do not accept this way of playing the game. The idea of iterative&#xD;
    development can start within any of these groups, but then you have to encourage the commitment and participation of&#xD;
    everyone else on the team, and this is a process of selling ideas and benefits, in a language that each group&#xD;
    understands. Failure to do so will generate tension, frustration, delays, and, ultimately, everyone will lose the&#xD;
    championship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Your stakeholders need to accept this idea about a game plan (an iteration), and how winning each &quot;game&quot; will require&#xD;
    different approaches. Stakeholder&amp;nbsp;input is fundamental. Your coach, the project manager, has to be able to guide&#xD;
    the team, bring valuable information, communicate with the stakeholders on behalf of the team, and facilitate the&#xD;
    interface between each player in a different role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After each game, as you plan for the next, everyone has to understand and communicate&amp;nbsp;the key factors leading to a&#xD;
    victory, defeat, or even a draw, and how these will affect the next game plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Involved roles&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This topic lists a few common roles that are present in most projects, either as a full-time or a part-time assignment,&#xD;
    and that are critical for successful adoption of an iterative development approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Stakeholder&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders&amp;nbsp;need to understand and accept the fact that information will be rough at first, and not accurate. Any&#xD;
    attempt at providing detailed specifications in the beginning will lead to false progress, consuming time and budget,&#xD;
    and often generating frustration.&amp;nbsp;Requirements, business rules, and technologies will be refined during all&#xD;
    iterations, and stakeholder participation early and often is a critical success factor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Project manager&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From the stakeholder's perspective, the designated project manager owns the plan and must be able to work with the team&#xD;
    to break the work into iterations, communicate the goals, and lead the team and stakeholders to follow the cycles, so&#xD;
    that the project can succeed. As part of the goal-definition effort, metrics must be adopted to understand success,&#xD;
    failure, and the reasons for either one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Software architect&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evolving design and architecture support the adopted iterative model, providing the foundation at the right moment for&#xD;
    the team. Architects help by understanding how much of the architecture is required for any given project type, and&#xD;
    they also highlight the critical pieces of the architecture that must be tested before you can rely on it to build your&#xD;
    software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Quality manager&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality managers&amp;nbsp;assemble a team and infrastructure suitable to support iterative testing, which will usually&#xD;
    start early in the project lifecycle and be cumulative. This means tests from early iterations tend to be reused all&#xD;
    along the project, such as a smoke test suite. Different testing skills, tools, and techniques should be available to&#xD;
    be employed according to the goals of any given iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Configuration&amp;nbsp;and build manager&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The role of configuration and build manager must ensure that tools and mechanisms are in place to deliver builds as&#xD;
    frequently required by the pace of iterations, which typically will demand that builds to be created earlier and more&#xD;
    often than in a&amp;nbsp;waterfall lifecycle.&#xD;
