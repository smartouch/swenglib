    <refinedDescription>&lt;p> During the conversations with stakeholders, the team identifies and captures &#xD;
  what makes each user story complete, such as these examples: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Unexpected behaviors&lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Exceptions and error conditions &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Different types of users that might exist&lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Data that needs to be in place&lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>These conditions, also called&lt;em> story&amp;nbsp;confirmations&lt;/em>, help the team&amp;nbsp;create &#xD;
  test cases to be&amp;nbsp;conducted so that they can later evaluate whether the &#xD;
  user story is complete and accepted by stakeholders. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Detailing user stories does not&amp;nbsp;imply that all&amp;nbsp;user stories&amp;nbsp;will &#xD;
  be detailed before commencing implementation on them. The level of detail captured &#xD;
  will vary, depending upon the needs of the project and the complexity of the &#xD;
  user story.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Nonfunctional requirements (such as expected performance, availability, adherence &#xD;
  to standards), as well as business rules&amp;nbsp;that apply to a specific user &#xD;
  story,&amp;nbsp;are also&amp;nbsp;captured as story confirmations for that user story. &#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Well-written user stories possess&amp;nbsp;the characteristics defined in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.user_story_driven_dev.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/invest_model_2D82989.html&quot; guid=&quot;_K8khID55Ed6FxpOwnkUDmw&quot;>INVEST Model&lt;/a>. For example, one of the characteristics of a good user story is that&#xD;
    it can be tested even before development begins. This makes the user story valuable to stakeholders in a practical way.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    User stories capture the intended functionality of the system under development, from the user role&#xD;
    perspective.&amp;nbsp;They are simple, clear, brief descriptions written&amp;nbsp;using business language in the context in&#xD;
    which the need or capability&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;used in the system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user story is in fact a reminder for further conversation between the team and stakeholders. User stories&amp;nbsp;are&#xD;
    written down, but they are not meant to be contractual, or even interpreted without further discussions with the&#xD;
    stakeholders. The on-going interaction between stakeholders and the team (to discuss the details of a user story) are&#xD;
    more important than the resulting textual description itself.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&amp;nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you&#xD;
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer&#xD;
    could&amp;nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new&#xD;
    elements to take its place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&amp;nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the&#xD;
    architecture within which the design exists.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally&#xD;
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task will be applied numerous times.&amp;nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&amp;nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and&#xD;
    reusable elements.&amp;nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing&#xD;
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate&#xD;
    while designing this portion of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&amp;nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and&#xD;
    consistency across the design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&amp;nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small&#xD;
    subset of requirements.&amp;nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,&#xD;
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some&#xD;
    scenario.&amp;nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&amp;nbsp;again later&amp;nbsp;to deal with a different context on the&#xD;
    same requirements.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&amp;nbsp;to the users, all&#xD;
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it&#xD;
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database&#xD;
    access, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In&#xD;
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more&#xD;
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity&#xD;
    to the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If this task is being performed on an architecturally significant element the results of this design should be&#xD;
    referenced by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Automate tests via a unit regression testing tool (for example, xUnit) so that tests may be run by developers&#xD;
        whenever they make changes to the code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test to the risk of the implementation element. For example, the more critical an element is, the more important it&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units&#xD;
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the&#xD;
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,&#xD;
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test&#xD;
    additional behavior.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A portion of the design is implemented by performing this task. This task can be performed any number of times during&#xD;

    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

        Interface Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;

        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
