    This activity is planned, with multiple occurrences. It is instantiated multiple times, one&amp;nbsp;for each&amp;nbsp;user&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If instantiated as a work item in a tool such as Rational Team Concert, it could be created as a&amp;nbsp;work&#xD;
    item&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;type&amp;nbsp;user story.&amp;nbsp;The summary field could follow the naming convention &lt;em>Develop User&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    We don't show&amp;nbsp;dependencies between the&amp;nbsp;task&amp;nbsp;to identify user stories and the tasks to develop user&#xD;
    stories because in many cases a task to develop a user story depends on identifying&amp;nbsp;that user story first but not&#xD;
    necessarily identifying all user stories first.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since this activity is&amp;nbsp;marked as having multiple occurrences,&amp;nbsp;we can't&amp;nbsp;determine dependencies in the&#xD;
    generic WBS because the real dependencies&amp;nbsp;will exist between&amp;nbsp;the actual instances of this&amp;nbsp;activity in a&#xD;
    real project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test motivator is usually an external file that provides details about a test plan or test case. For example, a test&#xD;
    motivator file could be a document or spreadsheet containing detailed information about a specific test plan or test&#xD;
    case. It is convenient to be able to reference a test motivator file from a test plan and test case record. Test&#xD;
    motivators are useful in linking test requirements with test plans and test cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div class=&quot;p&quot;>&#xD;
    You can use associations between test plan and test case records with a test motivator to determine: &#xD;

        &lt;li>&#xD;
            If there is test coverage for the motivator&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While managing the iteration at the project level, consider doing the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Track the iteration progress of each sub team. Have frequent meetings with&amp;nbsp;one representative&amp;nbsp;of each sub&#xD;
        team to understand progress and identify roadblocks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work with the sub teams in case work of an iteration needs to be descoped in order to meet iteration objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing the team is part of executing the project. Improve the interactions and trust between team members,&#xD;
    incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make decisions. Management is done by&#xD;
    objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Help the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the progress and work remaining&#xD;
    to completion. When the team is falling behind, help the team assess how it can reduce work and still meet the&#xD;
    iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that affect them, so that their objectives for&#xD;
    the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select an approach for the collection of basic metrics: ideally, they are automatically generated from the tools at&#xD;
    hand, but can be manually assembled, or both. &lt;span&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;

One or multiple storyboards may be defined for a use case, thereby supporting a use-case-driven approach to software engineering, as well as providing an excellent means to validate the user's (actor's) expectations of these use cases and their role in the use-case flows of events.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p> A user role&amp;nbsp;represents users of the system under development who have &#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Frequency of using the software&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    This artifact&amp;nbsp;describes the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_59A08DE0.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;
