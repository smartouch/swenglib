    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While managing the iteration at the project level, consider doing the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Track the iteration progress of each sub team. Have frequent meetings with&amp;nbsp;one representative&amp;nbsp;of each sub&#xD;
        team to understand progress and identify roadblocks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work with the sub teams in case work of an iteration needs to be descoped in order to meet iteration objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing the team is part of executing the project. Improve the interactions and trust between team members,&#xD;
    incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make decisions. Management is done by&#xD;
    objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Help the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the progress and work remaining&#xD;
    to completion. When the team is falling behind, help the team assess how it can reduce work and still meet the&#xD;
    iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that affect them, so that their objectives for&#xD;
    the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select an approach for the collection of basic metrics: ideally, they are automatically generated from the tools at&#xD;
    hand, but can be manually assembled, or both. &lt;span&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a team of teams context, the project leadership team produces iteration plans that drive the sub teams' iteration&#xD;
    plans. The high level&amp;nbsp;iteration plans are part of the larger project release plan, and they typically define:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cross-team items which will be facilitated by the project leadership team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Goals which should be injected into the&amp;nbsp;sub team plans&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;

        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While planning the iteration at the project level, consider doing the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the iteration work effort rolled up from each sub team corresponds to a reasonable amount of work for&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    During project planning, iterations are identified, but the estimates have an acceptable uncertainty due to the lack of&#xD;
    detail at the project inception. This task is repeated for each iteration within a release. It allows the team to&#xD;
    increase the accuracy of the estimates for one iteration, as more detail is known along the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that the team commits to a reasonable amount of work for the iteration, based on team performance from previous&#xD;
    iterations.&#xD;

    Use-case modeling&amp;nbsp;is one technique that can prove useful in defining the system boundaries and system behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consistently involve stakeholders. They are part of the team and their feedback&amp;nbsp;must be obtained along the way.&#xD;

    Reuse&amp;nbsp;must be encouraged and terms may be referenced in one or more glossaries as pertinent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using a visual technique rather than just text is helpful in identifying scenarios&amp;nbsp;in a system, and whom or what&#xD;

        Coordinate&amp;nbsp;the sub teams activities such as iteration assessment and demonstration of iteration results to&#xD;

    It is critical that this task be performed collaboratively with active involvement of other team members and project&#xD;

    technical work rather than putting in a solo performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this stage, you may find it useful to develop a draft version of your architectural models.&amp;nbsp; For more&#xD;
    information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task focuses on envisioning the initial architecture and outlining the&amp;nbsp;architectural decisions that will&#xD;
    guide development and testing. It relies on gathering experience gained in similar systems or problem domains to&#xD;
    constrain and focus the architecture so that effort is not wasted in re-inventing architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The results are captured for future reference and are communicated across the team. It is important that the team has&#xD;
    enough information to understand the technical approach being taken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture evolves organically over time by outlining and refining portions of it. A few people get together in a&#xD;
    room and sketch out what they think the architecture will be. This envisioning effort sets the foundation for&#xD;
    prototyping. If the solution is similar to a previously produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it&#xD;
    will probably be good enough to reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases,&#xD;
    it may be necessary to develop one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the&#xD;
    requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.&#xD;
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level. The conclusion of this work&#xD;
    should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and to demonstrate its viability to&#xD;
    the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to refine and baseline the architecture.&#xD;

    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;

    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a team of teams context, the project leadership team produces iteration plans that drive the sub teams' iteration&#xD;
    plans. The high level&amp;nbsp;iteration plans are part of the larger project release plan, and they typically define:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cross-team items which will be facilitated by the project leadership team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Goals which should be injected into the&amp;nbsp;sub team plans&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;
    results and actions from assessments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test motivator is usually an external file that provides details about a test plan or test case. For example, a test&#xD;
    motivator file could be a document or spreadsheet containing detailed information about a specific test plan or test&#xD;
    case. It is convenient to be able to reference a test motivator file from a test plan and test case record. Test&#xD;
    motivators are useful in linking test requirements with test plans and test cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div class=&quot;p&quot;>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    User stories capture the intended functionality of the system under development, from the user role&#xD;

    A user story is in fact a reminder for further conversation between the team and stakeholders. User stories&amp;nbsp;are&#xD;
    written down, but they are not meant to be contractual, or even interpreted without further discussions with the&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    This working version of the system or part of the system&amp;nbsp;is the result of putting the implementation through a&#xD;
    build process (typically an automated build script) that creates an executable version, or one that runs. This&#xD;
    executable version will typically have a number of supporting files that are also considered part of this artifact.&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;
    focus on divergent, seemingly independent issues of how the system will be put together and work, they should fit&#xD;
    together without contradiction.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as&#xD;
    specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has&#xD;
    run correctly.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Extension Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Report Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interface Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications define the boundaries between the different units of user documentation, as well as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        Content&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>Requirement attributes help the project team understand, prioritize, manage, track and validate the project requirements.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;
