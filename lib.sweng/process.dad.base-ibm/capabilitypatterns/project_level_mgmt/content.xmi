    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;

    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/testing_qualitative_rqmts_CAE80710.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aJ6cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Concept: Testing Qualitative Requirements&lt;/a>.&#xD;

    A user role&amp;nbsp;represents users of the system under development who have similar attributes. These are some of the&#xD;
    common attributes that differentiate user roles from each other:&#xD;

For example, one of the characteristics of a good user story is that&#xD;
    it can be tested even before development begins. This makes the user story valuable to stakeholders in a practical way.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    User stories capture the intended functionality of the system under development, from the user role&#xD;

    which the need or capability&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;used in the system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user story is in fact a reminder for further conversation between the team and stakeholders. User stories&amp;nbsp;are&#xD;
    written down, but they are not meant to be contractual, or even interpreted without further discussions with the&#xD;
    stakeholders. The on-going interaction between stakeholders and the team (to discuss the details of a user story) are&#xD;
    more important than the resulting textual description itself.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a team of teams context, the project leadership team produces iteration plans that drive the sub teams' iteration&#xD;
    plans. The high level&amp;nbsp;iteration plans are part of the larger project release plan, and they typically define:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    In a team of teams context, the project leadership team produces iteration plans that drive the sub teams' iteration&#xD;
    plans. The high level&amp;nbsp;iteration plans are part of the larger project release plan, and they typically define:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cross-team items which will be facilitated by the project leadership team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Goals which should be injected into the&amp;nbsp;sub team plans&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references those&#xD;
    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;
    results and actions from assessments.&#xD;
