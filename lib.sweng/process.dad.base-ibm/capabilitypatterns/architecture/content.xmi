&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is critical that this task be performed collaboratively with active involvement of other team members and project&#xD;
    stakeholders so that consensus and common understanding is reached. It is particularly vital to involve the&#xD;
    developer(s) throughout this task. The architecture effort&amp;nbsp;is about providing leadership and coordination of the&#xD;
    technical work rather than putting in a solo performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this stage, you may find it useful to develop a draft version of your architectural models.&amp;nbsp; For more&#xD;
    information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task focuses on envisioning the initial architecture and outlining the&amp;nbsp;architectural decisions that will&#xD;
    guide development and testing. It relies on gathering experience gained in similar systems or problem domains to&#xD;
    constrain and focus the architecture so that effort is not wasted in re-inventing architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The results are captured for future reference and are communicated across the team. It is important that the team has&#xD;
    enough information to understand the technical approach being taken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture evolves organically over time by outlining and refining portions of it. A few people get together in a&#xD;
    room and sketch out what they think the architecture will be. This envisioning effort sets the foundation for&#xD;
    prototyping. If the solution is similar to a previously produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it&#xD;
    will probably be good enough to reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases,&#xD;
    it may be necessary to develop one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the&#xD;
    requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.&#xD;
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level. The conclusion of this work&#xD;
    should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and to demonstrate its viability to&#xD;
    the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to refine and baseline the architecture.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    It is important to continue to reduce the complexity of the&amp;nbsp;solution by raising the levels of abstraction.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    For more information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continue the collaboration with the whole&amp;nbsp;team on the refining of the architecture in order to promote consensus&#xD;
    and a common understanding of the overall solution. The architect should be working to coordinate and guide the&#xD;
    technical activities of the team rather than doing all the work alone.&amp;nbsp;Place special emphasis&amp;nbsp;on&#xD;
    involving&amp;nbsp;the developer(s) throughout this task since it's the developed solution that will prove out the&#xD;
    architecture and may result in refinements to the architecture documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that those who need to act upon the architectural work&amp;nbsp;understand&amp;nbsp;it and are able to work with&#xD;
    it.&amp;nbsp;Make sure that the description of the architecture clearly conveys not only the solution but also the&#xD;
    motivation and objectives related to the&amp;nbsp;decisions that have been made in shaping the architecture. This will make&#xD;
    it easier for others to understand the architecture and to adapt it over time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can communicate your decisions as many ways as you wish.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Publication of&amp;nbsp;reference source code&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Publication of&amp;nbsp;reference models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Publication of&amp;nbsp;software architecture documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal&amp;nbsp;presentations of the material&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Informal walkthroughs of the architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    support development.&amp;nbsp; It takes into&amp;nbsp;account any design and implementation work products that have been&#xD;
    developed so far.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the architecture evolves as the solution is designed and implemented, and the&#xD;
    architecture documentation is updated to reflect any changes made during development. This is&amp;nbsp;a key,&amp;nbsp;since&#xD;
    the actual implementation is the only real &quot;proof&quot; that the software architecture is viable and provides the definitive&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>Requirement attributes help the project team understand, prioritize, manage, track and validate the project requirements.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;
to capture critical information about each requirement. The information that is captured in the attributes can used to&#xD;
generate views and reports, which are used to track and measure progress.</refinedDescription>

    &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'&quot;>In order to maintain the consistency&amp;nbsp;of the&#xD;
    traceability,&amp;nbsp;this artifact must be re-assessed every time there is a change to the requirement or at the end of&#xD;
    each milestone.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'&quot;>In a small simple project, the&#xD;
    traceability matrix can be&amp;nbsp;maintained in a spreadsheet. Automated tool support is helpful in a complicated&#xD;
    large-scale project.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are project resource costs to establishing and maintaining traceability. It is important to establish just enough&#xD;
    traceability to support completeness checking and change impact analysis without over-using the technique by tracing&#xD;
    &quot;everything to everything&quot;.&lt;br />&#xD;

    The Requirements Management Process Description describes the requirements artifacts, requirement types, their&#xD;

    organization, tool automation, the necessary reports, views, and queries that will be generated and the related&#xD;
    processes for requirements and requirements change management.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
One or multiple storyboards may be defined for a use case, thereby supporting a use-case-driven approach to software engineering, as well as providing an excellent means to validate the user's (actor's) expectations of these use cases and their role in the use-case flows of events.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p> A user role&amp;nbsp;represents users of the system under development who have &#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
