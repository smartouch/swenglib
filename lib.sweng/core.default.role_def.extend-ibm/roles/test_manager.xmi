  <mainDescription>Roles organize the responsibility for performing tasks and developing work products into logical groups. Each role can be&#xD;
assigned to one or more people, and each person can fill one or more roles. When staffing the Test Manager role, you need&#xD;
to consider both the skills required for the role and the different approaches you can take to assigning staff to the role.</mainDescription>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Supported by the following basic skills and expedience:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            general knowledge of all aspects of the software engineering process&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            experience in a wide variety of testing efforts, techniques and tools&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            people skills, especially diplomacy and advocacy skills&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            planning and management skills&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            knowledge of the domain, system or application-under-test (desirable)&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            experience programming or managing programming teams (desirable)&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role has these primary responsibilities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Negotiating the ongoing purpose and deliverables of the test effort&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Ensuring the appropriate planning and management of the test resources&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assessing the progress and effectiveness of the test effort&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Advocating the appropriate level of quality by the resolution of important Defects&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Advocating an appropriate level of testability focus in the software development process&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Manager role can be assigned in the following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one staff member to perform the Test Manager role only. This is a commonly adopted approach and is&#xD;
            particularly suitable for large teams or smaller teams where the Project Manager has minimal test experience.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one staff member to perform both the Project Manager and Test Manager roles. This strategy is a good&#xD;
            option for smaller test teams.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one staff member to perform both the Test Manager and Test Designer roles. This strategy is also a good&#xD;
            option for smaller test teams. A person filling both these roles needs to have strong management and leadership&#xD;
            skills as well as strong technical skills and experience.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one staff member to perform both the Test Manager and Test Analyst roles. This strategy is another&#xD;
            option for small to mid-sized test teams. You need to be careful that the minutia of the Test Analyst role does&#xD;
            not adversely effect the responsibilities of the Test Manager role. Mitigate that risk by assigning less&#xD;
            critical Test Analyst tasks to a person filling both these roles, leaving the most important tasks to team&#xD;
            members without any direct management responsibility.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div></assignmentApproaches>
