  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Roles organize the responsibility for performing tasks and developing work products into logical groups. Each role can&#xD;
    be assigned to one or more people, and each person can fill one or more roles. When staffing the Test Analyst role, you&#xD;
    need to consider both the skills required for the role and the different approaches you can take to assigning staff to&#xD;
    the role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some development cultures this role is called the &lt;i>Test Designer&lt;/i>, or considered a specialization of the&#xD;
    &lt;i>Tester&lt;/i> role.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The appropriate skills and knowledge for the Test Analyst role include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            good analytical skills&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            a challenging and inquiring mind&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            attention to detail and tenacity&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            understanding of common software failures and faults&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            knowledge of the domain (highly desirable)&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            knowledge of the system or application-under-test (highly desirable)&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            experience in a variety of testing efforts (desirable)&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role has these primary responsibilities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Identifying the Target Test Items to be evaluated by the test effort&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Defining the appropriate tests required and any associated Test Data&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Gathering and managing the Test Data&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Evaluating the outcome of each test cycle&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role can be assigned in the following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one or more test staff members to perform both the Test Analyst and Tester roles. This is a commonly&#xD;
            adopted approach and is particularly suitable for small teams and for any sized test team where the team is&#xD;
            made up of an experienced group of Testers of relatively equal skill level.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one or more test staff members to perform the Test Analyst role only. This works well in large teams,&#xD;
            particularly in situations where there are domain experts who have minimal test implementation experience but&#xD;
            who have significant domain knowledge to specify appropriate tests and determine the appropriate results for&#xD;
            those tests. This role assignment strategy is also useful to separate responsibilities when some of the test&#xD;
            staff have minimal test automation experience and would have difficulty filling the Tester and Test Designer&#xD;
            roles.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one staff member to perform both the Test Analyst and Test Manager roles. This strategy is another&#xD;
            option for small to mid-sized test teams. You need to be careful that the minutia of the Test Analyst role does&#xD;
            not adversely effect the responsibilities of the Test Manager role. Mitigate that risk by assigning less&#xD;
            critical Test Analyst tasks to a person filling both these roles, leaving the most important tasks to team&#xD;
            members without any direct management responsibility.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign one or more staff members to perform both the Test Analyst and requirements analyst/specifier roles.&#xD;
            This strategy is another option for small to mid-sized test teams, and is often used where domain experts are&#xD;
            available to play both roles. You need to be careful that appropriate effort is devoted to satisfying both of&#xD;
            these roles.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note also that specific skill requirements vary depending on the type of testing being conducted. For example, the&#xD;
    skills needed to successfully analyze the requirements for system load testing are different from those needed for&#xD;
    analyzing system functional testing requirements.&#xD;
