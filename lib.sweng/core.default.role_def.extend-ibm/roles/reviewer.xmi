    Any member of the project team can take on the &lt;a class=&quot;PresentationName&quot; guid=&quot;{638E0897-F63B-444C-8178-D05224689DE7}&quot;>Reviewer&lt;/a> role, as long as they have the appropriate pre-requisite&#xD;
    skills. For reviews that involve multiple team members, one person playing this role will also need to take&#xD;
    responsibility for coordinating the review process itself , playing the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.default.role_def.extend-ibm/roles/review_coordinator_D598A3E4.html&quot; guid=&quot;{D6CA9DC7-4DF2-4BA4-A0AD-7FBAEB6539E1}&quot;>Review Coordinator&lt;/a> role.

    categories: management reviews of project progress and technical reviews of project work products.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the type of review, management or technical, a different skill set will be required:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Technical: domain knowledge or subjective matter expertise appropriate to the work product being reviewed.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Management: many years of business (including contract formulation and negotiation), technical, and software&#xD;
            project management experience, excellent understanding of risk management principles and very good estimation&#xD;
            skills.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div>As a general rule, the review team should represent all the parties that have an interest in the work product being&#xD;
reviewed, including all the consumers of the work product. Therefore this role could be played by a person with a skill set&#xD;
that doesn't match the skills of the author, but could understand the impact on subsequent tasks in which the work product&#xD;
is consumed.</skills>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is assigned to one or more individuals on a case-by-case basis, according to the work product(s) being&#xD;
    reviewed, the teams involved and the availability of staff members to take part in the review.&#xD;
