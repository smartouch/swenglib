    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Monitor TSO session time in order to determine host usage compared to desktop solutions which impacts costs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a direct measure of the amount of time the user is connected to TSO.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the strategies in cost reduction is to assess what non-critical workloads could be shifted to lower cost&#xD;
    platforms. Modern desktop IDE's such as IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Developer for System z&amp;reg; include many features such as editing,&#xD;
    local syntax checking, source code and lifecycle management. As teams successfully adopt desktop solutions, there&#xD;
    should be a corresponding reduction in TSO session chargebacks as these less critical workloads are transferred to the&#xD;
    desktop..&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    TSO session time is a primary means of allocating and recovering host costs. In most organizations a deployment of a&#xD;
    new desktop enterprise IDE should include a plan for monthly comparison of host chargebacks versus desktop solution&#xD;
    usage to characterize the cost savings from shifting non-production workloads to the desktop.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    TSO session time is directly obtainable from the host. Since most organizations already have processes in place to&#xD;
    track and monitor TSO time, collection and reporting tools for host compiler use should be well-established. Desktop&#xD;
    solution use can be captured manually.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Features included in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Developer for System z&amp;reg; and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight can help you collect, analyze,&#xD;
    and report data for this metric.&#xD;
