    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a team stabilizes and scopes requirements at a high level, it is appropriate to refine the requirements to&#xD;
    lower-level requirements, specifying traceability between them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirement Traceability Coverage is a way to measure that sufficient effort is put toward refining requirements that&#xD;
    are within scope, and that a broad perspective is taken in that refinement effort. If high-level requirements are&#xD;
    defined, bit not traced to lower-level requirements, the team may not be delivering correct functionality that the&#xD;
    stakeholders need and expect.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some ways, this measure is a reciprocal of Untraced Requirements, though it used for a different purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The percent of high-level requirements that have lower-level requirements traced to them over time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a line chart to show the percentage of requirement traceability coverage throughout the lifecycle. Depending on the&#xD;
    kind of project, the desired value is moderated by trending toward a learned mid-range value (that is, there is the&#xD;
    possibility of too much traceability).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If Requirement Traceability Coverage is low, it is an indication that the team may be building a system that is not&#xD;
    aligned with business needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements traceability data can be obtained from&amp;nbsp;a Requirements Traceability Matrix. Tools like Rational Team&#xD;
    Concert or Rational Insight provide full support for collecting and reporting&amp;nbsp;traceability coverage&amp;nbsp;data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements should be traced at least two levels, from low-level requirements to high-lever requirements and&#xD;
        technical requirements to low-level requirements. For example,&amp;nbsp;product requirements traced&amp;nbsp;to customer&#xD;
        requirements and product-component requirements traced to product requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When there is a change to the requirements, traceability coverage should be updated and the changes&#xD;
        incorporated.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
