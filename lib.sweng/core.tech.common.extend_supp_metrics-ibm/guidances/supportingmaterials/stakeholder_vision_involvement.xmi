    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The vision document defines the stakeholder view of the technical solution to be developed. Stakeholder concurrence is&#xD;
    critical for project success, therefore the vision must be kept current and reviewed by stakeholders in each iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each iteration, count the number of stakeholders who have read the vision. Calculate the percentage as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholder Vision Involvement = (Number of Stakeholders Who Have Read The Vision / Total Number of Stakeholders) * 100&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Stakeholder Vision Involvement over time is to use a trend line. Plot the number of stakeholders&#xD;
    who have read the vision on the Y axis and iterations on the X axis. Group stakeholders by roles (e.g. users, sponsors)&#xD;
    to ensure that all key stakeholder roles are covered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - The team should see a steady, high percentage throughout inception and elaboration.&#xD;
    When stakeholders remain involved in the evolution of the vision, the risk to the project of misaligned expectations is&#xD;
    significantly reduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Declining stakeholder vision involvement&lt;/strong> - When the number of stakeholders who read the vision&#xD;
    declines after the initial iterations, the project is at risk. If the vision is not evolving and/ or not being&#xD;
    reviewed, the stakeholders and the team may not have a shared understanding of the system to be developed. The team may&#xD;
    deliver a solution that is unacceptable to one or more of its stakeholders. Confirm that the vision is easily&#xD;
    accessible, brief, and written in non-technical terms so that it is easy for all stakeholders to understand. Ensure&#xD;
    that a simple process is in place to alert stakeholders to vision updates requiring review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Ongoing low stakeholder vision involvement&lt;/strong> - This trend indicates a serious problem and requires&#xD;
    immediate attention. Stakeholders may not be involved because they do not support the project. Or, the team may have&#xD;
    incorrectly identified the list of stakeholders. It could be that the team has not put in place a consistent process&#xD;
    for collaborating with stakeholders. The team should reach out to stakeholders to confirm their support and&#xD;
    participation. Implement a consistent process for stakeholder review of the vision as it evolves.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data should be collected at the end of each iteration so that the team lead can analyze trends.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data can be captured in a simple spreadsheet with charting capabilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A vision has is developed and is maintained throughout the lifecycle&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A list of project stakeholders is confirmed and correct.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stakeholders have confirmed their commitment to the project and understand what participation is required.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The vision is stored in an easily accessible location&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the vision is not maintained, and does not evolve, stakeholders will not be incented to review it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When requests for review are sent to stakeholders, summarize any changes to the vision in the communication to&#xD;
        encourage stakeholders to review the updates.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to&#xD;
        make the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stakeholder involvement may taper off earlier for some stakeholder roles. For example, senior management may be&#xD;
        most involved early in the project.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
