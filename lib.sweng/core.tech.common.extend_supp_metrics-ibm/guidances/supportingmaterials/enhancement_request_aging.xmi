    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric helps the team understand whether enhancement requests are moving through their process efficiently. A high&#xD;
    number of open enhancement requests can significantly impact customer satisfaction, and the perceived value of the&#xD;
    system by its stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Count the number of days each enhancement request spends in each state (e.g. submitted, assigned, resolved).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Calculate the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Average number of days enhancement requests spend in each state.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maximum number of days enhancement requests spend in each state.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Minimum number of days enhancement requests spend in each state.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a bar chart to monitor Enhancement Request Aging. Plot the number of days on the Y axis, and the states on the X&#xD;
    axis. Plot a vertical bar for the average, maximum, and minimum days for each state. Use stacked bars to group by&#xD;
    severity, or produce a drill-down report for this information. It is also useful to monitor how many enhancement&#xD;
    requests have remained in specific date ranges by severity. Typically teams track under 30 days, 30-90 days, and over&#xD;
    90 days.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend -&lt;/strong> The average time in each state is acceptable (meeting the team's established target)&#xD;
    and there are no excessive maximum times. The average should not necessarily be the same for all states. For example,&#xD;
    an enhancement request should move quickly from Submitted to Assigned if the team's process is working efficiently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If average times are not acceptable in all states, the team may not have a consistent change management process or&#xD;
    efficient tooling in place. If tooling is not in place to help monitor requests, or there are disconnected processes or&#xD;
    too much overhead required, enhancement requests will not move through the system and customer satisfaction is likely&#xD;
    to suffer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data is collected throughout the lifecycle as requests are submitted, assigned, and resolved. The resulting Enhancement&#xD;
    Request Aging chart is shown by a team lead or project manager for review by the team and stakeholders at the end of&#xD;
    each iteration as needed to help identify trends and to take action based on findings.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Enhancement Request Aging for multiple projects can be rolled up quarterly in order to monitor improvement across the&#xD;
    organization in change management processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ClearQuest&amp;reg; collects enhancement request data.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enhancement Requests are submitted using a consistent and well-defined process using a tool that is easily&#xD;
        accessible to stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The product owner maintains a product backlog that is prioritized and updated as necessary to reflect changing&#xD;
        stakeholder needs and priorities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team has identified states for measurement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enhancement Request status updates are collected with date stamps&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enhancement Requests may be in some states more than once. Confirm the tool used accounts for this.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Priority of enhancement requests should be considered when setting target average aging for each state.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
