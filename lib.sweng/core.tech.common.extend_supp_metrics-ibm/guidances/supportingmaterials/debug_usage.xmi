    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Debug Time measures host resources and central processing unit (CPU) usage chargeable back to debug sessions. This&#xD;
    metric is useful for monitoring cost savings associated with shifting non-critical compilation workloads to the&#xD;
    desktop.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Debug Time = (Chargeable CPU + Host Session time sharing option (TSO) time allocated for application debug)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the strategies in cost reduction is to assess what non-critical workloads could be shifted to lower cost&#xD;
    platforms. With modern desktop IDE's such as IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Developer for System z&amp;reg; you can perform many development&#xD;
    tasks that previously required host resources. As teams successfully adopt desktop solutions, there should be a&#xD;
    corresponding reduction in charges for host debug as more of this work is transferred to the desktop.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Host resource use is already reported regularly in most organizations. A deployment of a new desktop enterprise IDE&#xD;
    should include a plan for monthly roll up of host and desktop resource use so that the cost savings from shifting&#xD;
    non-critical compilation workloads to the desktop can be observed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Host resource use is directly obtainable from the host. Since most organizations already have processes in place to&#xD;
    allocate and recover host resource costs from the user community, collection and reporting tools for this metric should&#xD;
    be well-established. In order to get a more complete characterization of the benefits being realized from the IDE,&#xD;
    desktop debug session times can be captured manually.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
