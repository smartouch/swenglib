    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;requirement set that&amp;nbsp;is unstable late in your project lifecycle, can indicate that a project is diverging&#xD;
    from delivering on its needed capabilities with respect to quality and reliability. Typically, this uncertainty is an&#xD;
    indication of churn, which is not desirable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This measure helps bring attention to ensuring that requirements are stable earlier in the project, to reduce the&#xD;
    impact of late discovery.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instability in requirements late in the lifecycle is often very costly given the investment that may have been made in&#xD;
    designing, implementing, and testing requirements that may no longer apply.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Percentage of new, modified, and de-scoped requirements during time i.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This measure applies separately, or combined, for each level of requirement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor the instability of the requirement set is with a line chart that shows the percentage change&#xD;
    throughout the lifecycle. Any increase in the instability of requirements in the latter half of the lifecycle is a&#xD;
    warning that their is a poor understanding of business needs or software requirements, and this may impact your team's&#xD;
    ability to deliver the needed capabilities with quality and predictability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg; and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Requirements Composer&amp;reg; are used to collect data for this this metric.&#xD;
