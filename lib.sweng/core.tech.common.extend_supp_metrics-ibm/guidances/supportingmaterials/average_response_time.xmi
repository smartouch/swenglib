    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Average Response Time is an indication of how well the team's change management process is functioning. When a change&#xD;
    request is submitted either to correct an identified defect or to add an enhancement, it must be reviewed as soon as&#xD;
    possible to determine if it will be approved or rejected. Approved changes will impact project planning so quick triage&#xD;
    is essential. It is also important to respond to the submitter in a timely manner, so that they will understand the&#xD;
    status of their request.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each submitted request in the reporting period, count the number of days that elapsed between the date the change&#xD;
    request was submitted and the date of response stating that the request is either approved or rejected. Group by&#xD;
    severity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Average Response Time = Total Number of Days Elapsed / Total Number of Change Requests&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Average Response Time over time is to use a trend line. Plot Average Response Time on the Y axis&#xD;
    and iterations on the X axis. Group change requests by severity and type (enhancement request or defect). It is also&#xD;
    useful to produce a drill down report showing the percentage of requests with response turnarounds&amp;nbsp;of 3 days or&#xD;
    less, 3-5 days, and more than 5 days.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Targets are typically established to measure progress. A common target is to achieve&#xD;
    an Average Response Time of one business day. Ideally, the trend line will remain steady at this level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High average turn-around time&lt;/strong> - This occurs when the team takes a long time to respond to most&#xD;
    submitted change requests. This can occur when the team has not implemented a consistent tool and/ or efficient process&#xD;
    for change management. Change requests might be getting lost or the team may not be alerted when new requests are&#xD;
    submitted. This trend can also occur when the process to submit a change request is not clear. Stakeholders may not be&#xD;
    providing the right information so impact analysis is taking too long. Adopt a change management practice suitable for&#xD;
    the team and type of project. Clearly communicate processes to the team and stakeholders. Implement an automated tool&#xD;
    to support the process and improve efficiency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the team's process and tools are working efficiently, long response times can be the result of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        an overly complex system architecture, or poor quality architecture (requiring additional time to perform impact&#xD;
        analysis)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        no resource(s) dedicated to impact analysis&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Long average response times can result in:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Low customer satisfaction levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Delays in deploying needed changes, and higher costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Duplicate effort when change requests are lost and then rediscovered&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use this metric to monitor the adoption of Formal Change Management and Team Change Management practices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Change request states are tracked throughout the lifecycle as they occur. The project manager should monitor trends,&#xD;
    and when problems arise should review with the team during iteration assessments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data is captured in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ClearQuest&amp;reg;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Change Requests are tracked, with dates captured for each state change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Clear change management procedures are communicated, describing all data that must be provided for change request&#xD;
        review, and roles responsible for reviews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Targets are set for change request response time&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Very small projects may not need to track this metric. Project scale, complexity, cost, and time constraints should&#xD;
        be taken into account when determining the need to track Average Response Time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A team may have a good Average Response Time, but if follow-through is poor (changes take too long to implement, or&#xD;
        are never implemented) overall customer satisfaction will suffer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
