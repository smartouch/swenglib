    Purpose&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric&amp;nbsp;shows the degree of consistency and alignment of the requirement set. It measures the number of&#xD;
    low-level requirements that are not substantiated by the presence of approved high-level requirements (as defined in&#xD;
    the Requirement Management Plan).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Untraced Requirements metric assumes that two or more levels of requirements are used. For instance, there are&#xD;
    features at one level that have traceability with use cases at a lower level. If use cases are present that do not have&#xD;
    traceability to features, then the use case may not be substantiated and within scope. If there are many levels of&#xD;
    requirements, then there may be multiple levels of traceability among the requirements. The measure of untraced&#xD;
    requirements among the levels could be assessed separately, in order to reflect consistency and alignment for different&#xD;
    purposes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Untraced requirements generally provide insight into the alignment of development efforts with business objectives.&#xD;
    This metric can be used to determine if your team&amp;nbsp;is putting effort towards requirements that do not have&#xD;
    higher-level justification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The percent of lower-level requirements (as defined in the RMP) not traced to higher-level requirements. This measure&#xD;
    applies separately (or combined) for each pair of requirement levels that have traceability among them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor untraced requirements is a line chart that shows the change in percent of low-level requirements&#xD;
    that are not traced to high-level requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, a non-zero measure reflects proper alignment and consistency. Typically, an increasing level of untraced&#xD;
    requirements indicates a challenge with keeping analysis efforts focused on those requirements that align with higher&#xD;
    business objectives. Additionally, a high percentage of untraced requirements reflects difficulty in managing scope&#xD;
    creep through the lifecycle. Lower-level requirements may not be traced initially early in the lifecycle, when&#xD;
    requirements are elicited, defined, and refined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is useful to create a drill through report to show the list of requirements that cannot trace to high level&#xD;
    requirements. Confirm with stakeholders that they need the functionality described in these requirements. Update high&#xD;
    level requirements to capture these requirements as needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Monitor Untraced Requirements each iteration during iteration planning to confirm that all low-level requirements the&#xD;
    team plans to implement in that iteration can be traced to high-level requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;The number of untraced requirements can be obtained from the Requirements Traceability Matrix. Various tools,&#xD;
    such IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; DOORS&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Requirements Composer&amp;reg;, and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg;&#xD;
    RequisitePro&amp;reg;, provide full support for&amp;nbsp;data collection and reporting of this metric.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            When refining high-level requirements to lower-level requirements, it is possible that you will derive new&#xD;
            requirements. The derived requirements should be added and documented in the requirement repository.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            90% of untraced requirements are product and product-component requirements, which are introduced with the&#xD;
            design solution [1]. So, it is important to pay more attention to the derived product and product-component&#xD;
            requirements that can be left untraced.&lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
