    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Average Time to Deploy is used to measure the effectiveness of the deployment process. It is distinct from other&#xD;
    metrics that measure the effectiveness of development or maintenance efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric can highlight problems specific to deploying mixed workload solutions into production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Average Time to Deploy = Elapsed time from when a package successfully completes validation to when it is successfully&#xD;
    promoted to production&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric can also be calculated as a percentage of time that&amp;nbsp;time to deploy&amp;nbsp;is less than or equal to the&#xD;
    target time to deploy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Monitor actual performance against specified targets. In the case where other factors, such as time to resolve a&#xD;
    change, defect density, and code churn are relatively constant across the enterprise, if the time to deploy&#xD;
    mixed-workload solutions is excessive and/or increasing to the point where key production deadlines are at risk, this&#xD;
    can indicate cross-component architectural issues, or inadequacies in the deployment infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Average time to deploy should be monitored continually. This metric should be used by project management and production&#xD;
    control to assess the effectiveness of the deployment process and identify problems before they become crises.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to get reliable data for this metric, it is necessary to configure the lifecycle management solution to manage&#xD;
    the deployment process in addition to the development process. In this case, the average elapsed time to deploy the system can be&#xD;
    derived from work-item statistics which are retrievable from IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Developer for System z&amp;reg; or IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg;&#xD;
    ClearQuest&amp;reg;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to distinguish that this metric is intended to measure the time it takes to deploy a change, and not&#xD;
    the time it takes to implement it. The significance of this is that there may be design, architectural or interface&#xD;
    issues between components that will not manifest themselves until the solution hits the production environment. In this&#xD;
    case, the investigation of deployment issues should extend beyond code and architecture issues within components. It&#xD;
    should consider cross-platform, environmental and other non-functional requirements.&#xD;
