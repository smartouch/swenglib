    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Teams monitor this metric to understand the status of all identified requirements. Some requirements are approved and&#xD;
    will be incorporated into the release. Others have been proposed by stakeholders, but not yet approved. Requirements&#xD;
    move between various other states as they are are being worked on, validated, and tested. The team needs to know the&#xD;
    state of each requirement and have visibility into requirements status trends across the lifecycle in order:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        to effectively plan and manage the project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        monitor scope creep&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        identify when corrective actions are necessary to meet release commitments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        help assess process improvements related to requirements management practices and tools&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Count: Total number of requirements in each status (approved, incorporated, proposed, validated)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be useful to group by requirement type, such as feature, supplementary, or use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Requirements Status Trend over time is with a stacked bar chart, plotting the number of&#xD;
    requirements for each status on the Y axis. A line chart is also useful for monitoring trends over time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - As the project progresses, the number of requirements in the initial statuses such as&#xD;
    &quot;Proposed&quot; should decrease and the number in later statuses such as &quot;Incorporated&quot; should increase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A high number of Proposed and Approved requirements remaining later in the lifecycle can indicate a problem. Some&#xD;
    requirements are likely to not be satisfied. Confirm that there is not a large number of high priority requirements&#xD;
    that are still in a proposed or approved state. When high priority requirements are not addressed, customer&#xD;
    satisfaction is likely to be very low and the project schedule is at risk. Confirm that timely reviews of proposed&#xD;
    requirements are taking place so that stakeholders are aware of the status of their requests (if they will be&#xD;
    implemented or not). In general, the team should review their current requirements management process to determine if&#xD;
    process improvements are necessary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A low number of validated requirements indicates that the team has not performed enough testing&amp;nbsp;on the system.&#xD;
    Focus on increasing&amp;nbsp;testing efforts. Review &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

     guid=&quot;_IJVvoCthEd6wLLxMlDYvug&quot;>Test Coverage of Requirements&lt;/a> or &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp_metrics-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/prct_of_tested_to_impl_rqmts_F5715220.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_d0AhINt9Ed604v6K1J0s_w&quot;>Percentage of Tested to Implemented Requirements&lt;/a> to ensure that all implemented&#xD;
    requirements have been tested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following figure is an example of a Requirements Status Trend chart, where the vertical axis represents the number&#xD;
    of requirements by status.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Trends should be monitored at the end of each iteration, and discussed with the team when problems are identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data can be collected with IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ReqPro&amp;reg; and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; DOORS&amp;reg;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Team members are consistently updating requirements information in a requirements management tool&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
