  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirement Aging is a measurement of the efficiency of the requirements management process. Teams monitor Requirement&#xD;
    Aging trends in order to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        determine whether requirements are being addressed in a timely manner&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        effectively manage and control the proposed requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        understand the length of time&amp;nbsp;that requirements stay in each state to help with future planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        determine if there is a problem with high severity, critical requirements taking too long to address&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Count the number of days each requirement takes to move to the next state (e.g. Proposed to Approved, Approved to&#xD;
    Incorporated, and Incorporated to Validated) and categorize by age group (e.g. less than 2 weeks, 1 month, and more&#xD;
    than 1 month).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    It is helpful to establish acceptable thresholds for how many days the team expects requirements to stay in each state.&#xD;
    These thresholds are used to assess the performance of the requirements management process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements can be grouped in each state by priority.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a bar chart to monitor Requirements Aging trends. Plot the percentage of requirements group on the Y axis, and the&#xD;
    requirement state group grouped by age group on the X axis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - It is possible that early in the lifecycle the majority of requirements may spend&#xD;
    more time (more than 1 month) in each state because of various uncertainties in the project (e.g. resource allocation&#xD;
    and unclear project scope). As the project progresses, and the team has a better understanding of the project and a&#xD;
    more stable project scope, requirements&amp;nbsp;are processed at a faster pace.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Compared to other states, approved requirements generally take more time to move to the incorporated state due to&#xD;
    implementation activities.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High percentage of requirements in the high age group&lt;/strong> (more than 1 month)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Proposed to Approved requirements - If a requirement stays too long in the proposed state there may be an&#xD;
        ineffective requirements management process in place.Or, the team ignores proposed requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Approved to Incorporated requirements - Remaining in the approved state for too long signifies that for some reason&#xD;
        the approved requirement was not incorporated into the system. It is possible that these requirements require a&#xD;
        long time to implement or they are low priority requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Incorporated to Validated requirements - Once the requirements are incorporated into the system, they should be&#xD;
        tested as soon as possible. There could be an issue with allocating appropriate testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Special attention should also be paid to requirements that stay in a particular state in the high age group late in the&#xD;
    lifecycle. The team should analyze the cause and take appropriate corrective action.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In some ways, this measure is the reciprocal of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp_metrics-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/rqmt_status_trend_3ACA3617.html&quot; guid=&quot;_xFRK4NkWEd66qZ_Nk08bBg&quot;>Requirements Status Trend&lt;/a>, though it serves a different purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data is harvested for reporting purposes before the end of each iteration/ phase / period of time. The team should&#xD;
    review any requirement aging issues during their iteration assessment meetings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ReqPro&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; DOORS&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Requirements Composer&amp;reg;, and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team&#xD;
    Concert&amp;reg;collect Requirement Aging data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team has a tool in place to collect requirements data, and has identified states for measurement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirement status updates are collected with date stamps&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements may be in some states more than once. Combine the number of days to the previous time they were in&#xD;
        that state. Confirm the tool used accounts for this.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This metric does not provide information about requirements that are proposed but no approved. To see the number of&#xD;
        non-approved requirements, use the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp_metrics-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/rqmt_status_trend_3ACA3617.html&quot; guid=&quot;_xFRK4NkWEd66qZ_Nk08bBg&quot;>Requirements Status Trend&lt;/a> metric&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Considerations for a traditional (non-Agile, non-iterative&amp;nbsp;approach) &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Early in the project lifecycle or in the requirements gathering period, a high number of requirements in&#xD;
                the proposed state in the more-than-10-days age group is not a bad sign because most all requirements are&#xD;
                newly gathered at once. However, the team should&amp;nbsp;focus on&amp;nbsp;processing the proposed requirements as&#xD;
                soon as possible.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                It is not acceptable to have a high number of non-approved requirements&lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
