    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stability of the high-level requirement set early in your project lifecycle reflects the health of a project, and the&#xD;
    effectiveness of the practices that the project employs. This measure brings focus on ensuring that high-level&#xD;
    requirements are stable earlier in the project. This reduces the impact of discovering high-level requirement changes&#xD;
    late in the lifecycle. Given the nature of requirements management as upstream of most other efforts, high-level&#xD;
    requirement stability is that much more important in achieving your project objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For purposes of this metric, the high-level requirement set typically includes the features and use cases. Lower-level&#xD;
    requirements than these are not included in this measure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Convergence toward zero in the number of new, modified, and de-scoped requirements earlier in the project lifecycle is&#xD;
    a desirable outcome. However, it is important to only converge toward a zero level while still allowing the opportunity&#xD;
    to innovate and remain adaptable to changing context. (That is why the term &quot;converge toward&quot; is used instead of&#xD;
    &quot;converge to.&quot;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Count:&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Number of new requirements during time &lt;strong>i&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>Number of modified requirements during time &lt;strong>i&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>Number of de-scoped requirements during time &lt;strong>i&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>Number of extraneous requirements during time &lt;strong>i&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The measure can be based on phase completion, or on the duration of this part of the project lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a time-based line chart to represent the stability of the high-level requirement set. The number of new, modified,&#xD;
    de-scoped, and extraneous high-level requirements are each placed on the y-axis. Expect significant change in the&#xD;
    high-level requirement set in the first third of the project lifecycle (typically through Inception and the first half&#xD;
    of Elaboration). Thereafter, stability in the high-level requirement set typically will improve certainty in achieving&#xD;
    the project goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, a reasonable target to achieve is for not more than 25% of your requirement set to change beyond the end of&#xD;
    inception, 10% beyond the end of elaboration, and 0% beyond the end of construction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Graphing the number of requirement set changes based on whether they are new, modified, de-scoped, or extraneous can&#xD;
    provide you with more insight. For instance, an increase in high-level requirement de-scoping late in the lifecycle is&#xD;
    an indication that the project was not properly scoped initially, and that this was not discovered or remedied until&#xD;
    very late. More attention should then be placed on properly managing the scope of projects throughout the lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If, at the same time, new requirements were being added even midway through the lifecycle, there should have been a&#xD;
    commensurate change in the schedule and budget, or other requirements should have been de-scoped at that time. If these&#xD;
    events do not occur in the same time period, this indicates unmanaged scope creep. Similarly, if a high number of&#xD;
    requirements continue to be modified late into the lifecycle, this reflects a need to establish stability in the&#xD;
    requirement set earlier in the lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Requirements Composer&amp;reg; are used to collect data for this&#xD;
    this metric.&#xD;
