    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment Success Rate is used to measure the effectiveness of the team and infrastructure to successfully transition&#xD;
    change packages into production. A low deployment success rate can indicate a problem in the software delivery process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment success rate is the number of successful deployments that transition from validation (testing) into&#xD;
    production as a percentage of all deployment attempts:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Deployment Success Rate = (Total successful deployments/Total attempted deployments) x 100&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment success should be monitored over time. There is a cost associated with each failed deployment. You can use a&#xD;
    trend line to plot the success rate over time. The percentage is plotted on the Y axis. The X axis shows time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Deployment success should be monitored on an ongoing basis, and made easily available to project managers and&#xD;
    production management.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment success rate can be derived from IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ClearQuest&amp;reg; or IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;. The products&#xD;
    would be configured to record deployments as one of the standard state change operations in the lifecycle. This is a&#xD;
    standard practice. No special customizations to either tool are necessary.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Care must be taken to understand the definition of a failed deployment. There are other metrics which are used to&#xD;
    measure packages (fixes) that that fail verification.&lt;br />&#xD;
    This metric refers to packages which appear to pass successfully through the validation process, but fails to&#xD;
    transition successfully into production.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    An increasing rate of failed deployments can indicate an underlying problem with the process or software delivery&#xD;
    infrastructure. These failures can become more pronounced in organizations which are transitioning from parallel, yet&#xD;
    isolated development and production environments to an integrated set of environments that must routinely deliver&#xD;
    packages with arbitrary combinations of workload components with increasingly sophisticated interdependencies.&lt;br />&#xD;
