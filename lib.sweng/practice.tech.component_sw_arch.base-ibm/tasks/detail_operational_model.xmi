  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Detail the required operational characteristics and capabilities of the IT system architecture and&amp;nbsp;describe, at an&#xD;
    architectural level, the network of computer systems and their associated peripherals, together with the systems&#xD;
    software, middleware, and application software that they run in order to support the users of the system.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use reference architectures as a source for specification when there is a good fit to the target problem domain.&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>The logical level of the operational model is developed in parallel with the physical operational model and is tightly&#xD;
coupled with both its development and also the development of the component model. Therefore decisions made when developing&#xD;
the logical operational model may result in changes to both the physical operational model and the component model.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The state of the operational model which needs to be reached at the end of this task is dependent on the context in which&#xD;
it is being developed, the level of confidence that needs to be achieved in the architecture and design, and the degree of&#xD;
accuracy of estimates of resources to further develop the operational model.</keyConsiderations>

    The purpose of this step is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        develop a specification of the functions, configuration and responsibilities of nodes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        develop a detailed technical specification against which an architect can evaluate alternative products, or even&#xD;
        against which technology vendors can submit proposals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Develop a detailed description of each node, which usually includes a table or box diagram that identifies and&#xD;
    classifies the software components that run on the node. Components (which may not all be software) may be grouped into&#xD;
    deployment units for ease of placement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The description includes the node's availability, performance, security and other non-functional characteristics. (A&#xD;
    non-functional characteristic is what is achieved; a non-functional requirement is what is required).&#xD;

    Describe the connections between the system nodes at a logical level. This is usually done in table format using from&#xD;
    node/to node columns that are further subdivided by individual communications between the nodes. The specification&#xD;
    consists of the following information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The end points (node names) of the connection and the business traffic it supports.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the connections and its characteristics. For example, security, data type (e.g. character, image),&#xD;
        protocol used and nature of the connection (e.g. messaging).&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation of the expected workload for each connection in terms of transactions and packet sizes. Traffic is&#xD;

    The physical specification is fully constrained by the limitations of the technology available, geography and the&#xD;
    environment. Fine-grained, detailed models and specifications are produced. The operational model at this point is a&#xD;
    complete architectural specification of the IT system, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        software products, hardware products and communication connections to enable products to be ordered. This may&#xD;

        unit-tested. The output of this task is an elaboration of the node descriptions, connection descriptions, system&#xD;

    This step is&amp;nbsp;performed to ensure the right balance between requirements and practicality for the operational model&#xD;
    in the delivery of the solution's functional and non-functional requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is almost inevitable that, while assessing the operational model's ability to achieve the various non-functional&#xD;
    requirements, some shortfall or other will be identified, which will require the operational model to be changed.&#xD;
    Possibly, it will prove to be impossible, within practical bounds, to achieve all aspects of the solution's&#xD;
    non-functional requirements. For example, the delivery of very high levels of availability may compromise the&#xD;
    solution's ability to deliver sub-second response times.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This sub-task assesses the implications of these conclusions for the operational model and, where necessary and&#xD;
    practical enhances the design. Alternatively, where such changes are not considered desirable or where requirements are&#xD;
    found to be in conflict, this task ensures the requirements are refined and balanced to &quot;the art of the&#xD;
    possible&quot;.&lt;br />&#xD;
