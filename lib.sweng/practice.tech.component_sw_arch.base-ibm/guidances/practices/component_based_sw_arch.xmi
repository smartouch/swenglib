  <mainDescription>The component based architecture practice helps teams developing large or complex systems manage the complexity of the&#xD;
design and produce a system that is maintainable in the future. &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
This practice is most beneficial on projects where the team or system is large or complex.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
It is useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where you expect new team members to participate in the&#xD;
development or maintenance of the system over time.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
This practice is especially useful when there are many variants of the system. For example, this practice helps in the&#xD;
design a system for multiple target environments that require separate design architectures. &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Distributed, outsourced, or globally dispersed teams benefit from this practice. These teams require a more formal means of&#xD;
communicating the dependencies between the parts of the system each location is developing.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <additionalInfo>For more information on this practice,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/practices/compbased_sa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>practice resource page&amp;nbsp;on&#xD;
IBM&amp;reg; DeveloperWorks&amp;reg;&lt;/a>.</additionalInfo>
  <problem>This practice improves productivity by accelerating the team's comprehension of the system and improving team&#xD;
communication. It decreases the amount of time a team member needs to find the correct location in the system to make a&#xD;
change. It increases quality by clarifying which system elements need to be retested after a change is made.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
This practice reduces time to market by identifying components with well defined interfaces that can be developed in&#xD;
parallel, reused, and outsourced. Since the required functionality of each part of the system is clear, you are able to&#xD;
assign the best possible resources to design and develop each architectural element. &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Adopting this practice improves predictability and project oversight. A component based architecture helps a project&#xD;
manager scope the work needed and properly plan, coordinate and track the efforts of team members. &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
This practice results in a consistent system design, as it helps bring similar design needs to the surface.&lt;br /></problem>
  <application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before reading this practice, you should familiarize yourself with the enablement materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin reading this practice by reviewing these key concepts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_59A08DE0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__O7tAMVvEduLYZUGfgZrkQ&quot;>Software Architecture&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/component_CB167D48.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0YP18MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Component&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, review the work products and tasks. When a work product or task refers to a key concept or more detailed&#xD;
    guidance, review those elements at that time, or save the detailed reading for last.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use templates and checklists associated with the work products to guide you as you complete and evaluate them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use measurements to guide you on assessing how well you are following the practice.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></application>
