    The Performance Measurement practices help you to set up and operate a performance measurement system so you understand&#xD;
    whether your organization is performing as desired, and guide you in what actions to take to improve your performance.&#xD;
    Let's take a look at some key usage scenarios for these practices.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    We focus on measurements, dashboards and improvement actions along&amp;nbsp;five dimensions&amp;nbsp;that we have found&#xD;
    relevant for almost all organizations that we have worked with. You may care about a 6th or 7th dimension, such as&#xD;
    compliance, and you can apply the same thought process also to your own additional dimensions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In the Practices for Performance Measurement configuration we provide suggestions for each dimension&amp;nbsp;on what&#xD;
    measures to leverage to understand whether a project meets your target objectives, including exemplary dashboards to&#xD;
    consider. You find that further drill down leads to descriptions of metrics, and that many metrics have guidance on how&#xD;
    to interpret them and what corrective actions to take based on what they are showing.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    These same project level metrics and dashboards can be used to measure performance across a set of projects. If you&#xD;
    find that your projects frequently fail to perform according to one or several dimensions (so you e.g. need to reduce&#xD;
    cost and improve time-to-delivery across one or several projects),&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/value_traceability_tree_5D64B55D.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CkI9oONsEd6BSpdo_oJF_A&quot;>Value Traceability Trees&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(VTTs) guide you in what systemic improvement actions&#xD;
    to take. The VTT for each dimension, articulates strategies and solutions that can provide a systemic improvement in&#xD;
    performance, symptoms to look for to determine which strategies and solutions to apply, and the practices, and metrics&#xD;
    and tools that help you effectively implement target solutions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    When you are making&amp;nbsp;changes to how you work, you want to make sure those changes lead to better results. These&#xD;
    Performance Measurement practices guide you in how to effectively set up and leverage &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/multi_tiered_measurement_234F76DB.html&quot; guid=&quot;_JDuEoN47Ed2J7couKHLTuw&quot;>MCIF's tiered measurement system&lt;/a> to both understand whether you get the desired&#xD;
    outcome (through outcome measures), and whether the improvement actions you are taking are effectively implemented&#xD;
    (through control measures).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Throughout, you will find extensive guidance on measurements to consider. As an example, for almost every practice&#xD;
    (such as iterative development, continuous integration, and test management) we guide you in what are the key&#xD;
    measurements to understand how well you are&amp;nbsp;performing the practice. We also provide guidance on how to&#xD;
    effectively leverage our Performance Measurement product,&amp;nbsp;IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight&amp;reg; to set up a measurement system.&#xD;
