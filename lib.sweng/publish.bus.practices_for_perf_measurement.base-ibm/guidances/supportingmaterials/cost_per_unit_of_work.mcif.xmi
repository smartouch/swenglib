    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric is used to monitor costs throughout the project lifecycle based on the cost of the team and their velocity.&#xD;
    The calculated value of delivering a point is multiplied by the total number of points in the backlog in order to&#xD;
    monitor and project the estimated cost of the project at completion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As team velocity increases over time, cost per unit of work decreases. However, if team velocity drops due to factors&#xD;
    such as unexpected rework or re-estimation, cost per unit of work increases, potentially negatively impacting the&#xD;
    project budget. Monitoring this metric in each iteration helps the team understand if they are burning budget at a&#xD;
    sustainable rate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cost per Unit of Work for a given iteration = cost of the team for the iteration / velocity&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of the team is typically calculated based on the number of hours worked by each team member and their internal&#xD;
    rate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Cost per Unit over time is to use a trend line. Plot Cost per Unit on the Y axis and iterations&#xD;
    on the X axis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Using Cost per Unit of Work to monitor project execution&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cost per Unit of Work is used as a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.perf_meas_setup.extend_prac2-ibm/customcategories/project_execution_metrics_C29D56DC.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_Y_xjcLQoEd6HgZ8EwRW1Og&quot;>Project Execution metric&lt;/a> to help a team monitor and steer their project&#xD;
    performance. As the cost of delivering each point is tracked across iterations, trends are identified to help the team&#xD;
    predict if they will complete the project within the planned budget. If the Cost per Point remains too high, the team&#xD;
    can take appropriate corrective action to meet the needs of its stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Cost per Point is typically higher in early iterations, decreasing as team velocity&#xD;
    increases. As velocity stabilizes so does Cost per Point (assuming that team costs also remain stable), enabling better&#xD;
    forecasting of project cost at completion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Sudden spike&lt;/strong> - This trend indicates some disruption occurred to drive costs up, productivity down, or&#xD;
    both. When a new team member is added in an attempt to increase velocity, the team cost increases but velocity may take&#xD;
    time to increase as the new person gets acclimated. This can temporarily inflate the Cost per Point. Monitor velocity&#xD;
    to confirm that team productivity improves as the result of the addition. Cost per Point can also spike when there is a&#xD;
    large amount of rework required, resulting in a significant reduction in the team's ability to deliver new&#xD;
    functionality. Analyze the associated change requests to determine if the team needs to do a better job of clarifying&#xD;
    stakeholder requirements or focus more on the quality of their delivered code. This trend can also occur when one or&#xD;
    more work items planned for an iteration are significantly underestimated. It is important to determine the cause of&#xD;
    the estimation variance in order to know the correct corrective action to take. The team may need to work harder to&#xD;
    address unknowns in the project or get stakeholder clarification on requirements before providing detailed estimates&#xD;
    for the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While this metric is useful for projecting the impact of disruptions throughout the lifecycle of the project, it can&#xD;
    also help measure the impact of efficiency improvements implemented by the team.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Using Cost per Unit of Work to monitor capability improvement&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cost per Unit of Work is also used as a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.perf_meas_setup.extend_prac2-ibm/customcategories/capability_improvement_metrics_2E2DA03B.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_kDlPILQoEd6HgZ8EwRW1Og&quot;>capability improvement&lt;/a> metric. It helps a team and middle management (project&#xD;
    manager, product owner) monitor improvements made during the project lifecycle in adopting practices such as &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.perf_meas_setup.extend_prac-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/iterative_development_6A86E97C.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_7_ZcMBJPEd6XR8gtzfa27w&quot;>Iterative Development&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.perf_meas_setup.extend_prac-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/release_planning_CCF17DC4.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_2GX2gBJTEd6XR8gtzfa27w&quot;>Release Planning&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Teams successfully adopting these practices will demonstrate improvements across the lifecycle, such as delivering&#xD;
    working software in time-boxed iterations, collaborating with stakeholders and receiving frequent feedback,and&#xD;
    performing just in time planning each iteration, that will help to reduce the costs of delivering functionality.&#xD;
    Operational Executives can also use this metric to monitor systematic improvement in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.perf_meas_setup.extend_prac2-ibm/customcategories/reduce_cost_EE4366D5.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_5w8E4LbEEd6_i8GY7ieNyA&quot;>reducing Cost&lt;/a> across the organization by adopting these practices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend -&lt;/strong> Successful teams decrease their cost per point by increasing their velocity as the&#xD;
    project progresses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Cost Per Unit remains high throughout the lifecycle&lt;/strong> - When teams typically show no or little reduction&#xD;
    in the Cost per Unit of Work as their projects progress, it can indicate trouble in adopting Iterative Development and&#xD;
    Release Planning practices. Teams may not be delivering working software in each iteration, keeping their velocity low,&#xD;
    resulting in a high cost per point. Or they may be estimating their work too far out in the future rather than&#xD;
    providing detailed estimates at the beginning of the iteration for which the work is planned.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cost per Point is calculated at the end of the iteration when costs and velocity are known. The Cost per Point chart&#xD;
    can be shown by a team lead during the iteration review with stakeholders to illustrate any impacts to project&#xD;
    costs.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team costs are typically tracked in a spreadsheet or project management tool. Iteration Velocity is captured in IBM&amp;reg;&#xD;
    Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;. A Cost Per Unit trend chart can be created in a simple spreadsheet with these inputs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Iterations are scheduled and time-boxed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team has a prioritized backlog of work items that is maintained on a daily basis&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User stories or use cases are elaborated and estimated in terms of points&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team is delivering working software every iteration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Because Cost per Unit of Work is affected by the cost of the team, organizations may be tempted to increase Cost&#xD;
        per Point with cheaper resources. However, cheaper resources may not be as productive, canceling out the savings by&#xD;
        delivering less.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost per Unit does not include non-staffing costs of development (such as hardware and development tools) which can&#xD;
        also significantly impact the actual cost at completion of a project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost per Unit in the first iteration is not a useful metric for projecting actual costs of the project, because the&#xD;
        team still has many unknowns to address and their velocity has not yet stabilized.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do not compare Cost per Point among teams. This metric is dependent on velocity which is specific to individual&#xD;
        teams. Different teams will likely have different estimates and different story point costs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In agile projects, cost is typically a constraint and budgeting is more an exercise in monitoring how much value&#xD;
        can be delivered by the team over the project lifecycle for the approved budget.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lowering Cost per Point is a goal for teams striving to stay within budget, but countermeasures should be monitored&#xD;
        to ensure that this is not achieved at the expense of quality or customer satisfaction. Confirm stakeholder&#xD;
        satisfaction is high by verifying they are receiving their requested functionality and that the quality of&#xD;
        delivered software is high.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
