    &lt;p>&#xD;
        In a world of rapidly changing products and punishing competition, mastering the management of business process&#xD;
        changes can be a key competency that distinguishes winners from losers. (Approximately 70% of business process&#xD;
        reengineering efforts, or redesigns, fail [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_cots-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_38304F32.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_1_bt0QiNEeCt4-FxrVeQpQ&quot;>KOC99&lt;/a>].) The adoption of a powerful concept, process, method, and/or tool often&#xD;
        holds the promise of dramatic benefits to an organization. Efforts to realize these benefits, however, often result&#xD;
        in frustration and anger from precisely those people who should benefit from the adoption. Business process change&#xD;
        management is, therefore, not an isolated task but a process that touches many of the socio-technical tasks at work&#xD;
        in an organization. A structured approach to managing the human elements is critical to achieving strategic&#xD;
        business objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        The quality and appropriateness of a new technical solution has been shown to be a poor predictor of the success of&#xD;
        a fielding in terms of the actual utilization of the new useful capabilities. A one-size-fits-all approach to&#xD;
        fielding and utilization of a solution seldom works. Successful fielding and utilization requires an appreciation&#xD;
        of the unique characteristics of each organization into which the technical solution will be fielded, and tasks to&#xD;
        support utilization will be tailored to fit those characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        Gaining predictable value from a new technology solution might require a number of people in the organization to do&#xD;
        their jobs differently. End-user business processes may change specifically to meet business objectives or they may&#xD;
        change to accommodate the business processes inherent in components under consideration within a technical&#xD;
        solution. An integral part of building and fielding a new technology solution requires anyone affected by the&#xD;
        solution to participate in defining and evaluating the solution so that they understand and support the tradeoffs&#xD;
        between business process changes required in various aspects of their jobs and an evolving understanding of the&#xD;
        capabilities of the components available &quot;off-the-shelf&quot;, the design of the architecture that links the components,&#xD;
        and the costs, schedule and risk of implementing the solution. This support must survive any turnovers and changes&#xD;
        in priorities, leadership, management, and reorganizations that occur in the organization from the time the change&#xD;
        is discovered to when it is fully implemented across the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step in developing the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_yylROewiEd-sjp03to1LnQ&quot;>Business Process Change Management Plan&lt;/a> is to define the scope of the business&#xD;
    process change effort. The scope is to clearly describe and gain agreement on the logical boundaries of the business&#xD;
    process change effort. The scope statement will be used to define what is within the boundaries of the business process&#xD;
    change effort and what is outside those boundaries based on the organizations and departments that are impacted and the&#xD;
    major business functions being eliminated, re-engineered, or added.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following artifacts can be helpful in defining scope:&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is a good practice to include as part of your scope definition those organizations that are in scope and those&#xD;
    related organizations that are out of scope. The readers can then determine more easily if they are impacted or&#xD;
    expected to assist in the project. Also, it might make sense to identify the organizations that are in scope so that&#xD;
    you can have people from those organizations represented on the project team, perhaps on a steering committee.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Additionally, include as part of your scope definition:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Constraints&lt;/strong> &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify constraints based on business functions, such as: &#xD;
                &lt;ul>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Political constraints&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Geographical constraints&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Customer service requirements&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Budgetary considerations&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;/ul>&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify the constraints and critical success factors that must be present to maximize the success of&#xD;
                business process change effort such as: &#xD;
                &lt;ul>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Project team resources&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Proposed development environment&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Expected delivery dates&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;

                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;

        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Risks&lt;/strong> - Risk refers to future conditions or circumstances that exist outside of the control of the&#xD;
        project team that will have an adverse impact on the project if they occur. In other words, whereas an issue is a&#xD;
        current problem that must be dealt with, a risk is a potential future problem that has not yet occurred. See &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Assumptions&lt;/strong> - Assumptions are external events that must occur for the project to be successful. If&#xD;
        it looks more than likely that these events will occur, they should be listed as assumptions. Assumptions can be&#xD;
        identified through your own experience of knowing what tasks or events are likely to occur in your organization;&#xD;
        brainstorming sessions with the clients, stakeholders and team member; and by looking at items that were identified&#xD;
        as low risk in the risk management process.&#xD;

    The initial Business Process Change Management Plan review is held near the end of the inception phase, when the&#xD;
    initial&amp;nbsp;project plan&amp;nbsp;is developed and includes a high-level phase plan that the project team has a high&#xD;
    degree of confidence in.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Subsequent Business Process Change Management Plan reviews are held at scheduled points where project plans are&#xD;
    expected to be revised for example, at the end of each iteration. They are also held at &quot;unscheduled&quot; points triggered&#xD;
    by the need to make changes to the plan as a result of problems in the project.&#xD;
