    This step begins in the inception phase as market research is conducted and general trends within the relevant market&#xD;
    sector are understood. The information is amplified for each COTS package and its vendor as COTS packages are&#xD;
    identified to be included in candidate solutions. In the elaboration phase, the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.cots_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/cots_package_dossier_CBE1A5C1.html&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_yycHJOwiEd-sjp03to1LnQ&quot;>Vendor Dossier&lt;/a> are updated to reflect those COTS packages that are included in the&#xD;
    selected solution. This information is updated routinely through the construction and transition phases to help&#xD;
    proactively plan COTS package updates throughout the life of the COTS package in the system.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Starting in the inception phase, this strategy is developed and captured in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.cots_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/cots_vendor_management_plan_B81891E.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_yylROOwiEd-sjp03to1LnQ&quot;>Vendor Management Plan&lt;/a> as part of each candidate solution. The vendors selected for&#xD;
    inclusion are those whose COTS packages play a significant role in the solution. The nature of the relationship will&#xD;
    depend on the leverage the project has or needs to have over COTS package support and upgrades, and will evolve through&#xD;
    the later phases. The plan written in the inception phase is updated in the elaboration phase as COTS packages are&#xD;
    selected. During the construction phase the plan is updated when the vendor support of the COTS package changes and&#xD;
    upgrades to COTS packages occur.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin interacting with vendors and vendor-related user groups in the inception phase. The relationship with each vendor&#xD;
    becomes more directed and involved when the COTS package is selected in the elaboration phase and then continues&#xD;
    through the construction and transition phases as long as the COTS package is part of the solution.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin establishing and nurturing relationship with other customers in the inception phase and continue through the&#xD;
    transition phase. It is just as important to stay connected with other customers who use the COTS package as it is to&#xD;
    interact directly with the vendor. Lessons in the use of the COTS package can and should be shared. In addition, it is&#xD;
    important to understand the forces that are driving the vendor to make COTS package changes. Unified customers seeking&#xD;
    a particular enhancement are a formidable incentive for the vendor.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin these relationships in the elaboration phase as COTS packages are selected. Close relationships might be critical&#xD;
    to success in the construction phase as COTS packages are integrated into higher-level subsystem components or into the&#xD;
    broader organization's architecture. Where possible, these relationships should be continued in the transition phase to&#xD;
    help resolve COTS package mismatches that occur as part of new COTS package upgrades.&#xD;
