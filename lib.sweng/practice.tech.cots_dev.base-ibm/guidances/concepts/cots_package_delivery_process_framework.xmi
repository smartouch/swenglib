    Process Framework based on RUP Phases, RUP Iterations and EPIC Principles&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section presents the EPIC &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_cots-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_38304F32.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_1_bt0QiNEeCt4-FxrVeQpQ&quot;>[ALB0702,ALB1102]&lt;/a> principles in the context of RUP phases and RUP iterations. The&#xD;
    EPIC principles are the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Topic2&quot;>Iteratively Converging Decisions&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Topic3&quot;>Accumulating Knowledge&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Topic4&quot;>Increasing Stakeholder Buy-in&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Topic2&quot; name=&quot;Topic2&quot;>&lt;/a>Iteratively Converging Decisions&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    In order to maintain balance between the four spheres, EPIC creates an environment that supports the iterative&#xD;
    definition of the four spheres over time while systematically reducing the trade space within each. This allows a&#xD;
    decision in one sphere to influence, and be influenced by, decisions in the other spheres. Initially, as shown at the&#xD;
    left of the figure below, the trade space may be large. There is flexibility for making tradeoffs between the&#xD;
    stakeholder needs and user business processes, the architecture and design, the offerings of the marketplace and other&#xD;
    sources, and programmatics and risk. As EPIC is used to drive toward a refined understanding of the solution, the trade&#xD;
    space shrinks. The spheres increasingly overlap as fewer decisions remain in any single sphere that can be made without&#xD;
    significant impact on the others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Figure showing how spheres of influence converge over time&quot; src=&quot;resources/Concept_Spheres.jpg&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;455&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An iterative development process is necessary to keep the requirements and architecture fluid as the four spheres of&#xD;
    influence are considered and adjusted in order to optimize the use of available COTS packages. Each iteration contains&#xD;
    tasks that gather information from each of the four spheres. Each iteration refines the newly gathered information&#xD;
    through analysis and negotiation with affected stakeholders, to form the harmonized knowledge needed to assemble an&#xD;
    executing system implementing the solution and supporting the needed user business processes. The iterations are&#xD;
    managed by the four RUP phases and associated milestones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;Iterations managed by the four RUP phases&quot; src=&quot;resources/Concept_RUP.jpg&quot; width=&quot;446&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Topic3&quot; name=&quot;Topic3&quot;>&lt;/a>Accumulating Knowledge&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Concurrent with diminishing the trade space, knowledge about the solution must grow at a controlled pace. This&#xD;
    knowledge is reflected in the set of artifacts necessary to evaluate, recommend, acquire, install, configure, field and&#xD;
    evolve the solution. Most of the artifacts are started in outline form and are expanded as more information is gathered&#xD;
    and refined. This knowledge includes an increasingly detailed understanding of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Capabilities and limitations of candidate COTS packages, the vendors that produce them and the marketplace&#xD;
            drivers that control them.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Negotiated and prioritized stakeholder needs and user business processes.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Architectural alternatives and mechanisms to integrate the COTS packages into the acquiring environment.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Implications of the COTS packages on the stakeholder needs and user business.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Planning necessary to implement and field the solution (including any needed user business changes) and&#xD;
            associated cost, schedule and risk.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is particularly important to keep knowledge current about the COTS packages critical to the solution and the&#xD;
    marketplace or other sources that supply COTS packages. This allows the organization to track trends that may affect&#xD;
    the solution over time. This also allows them to keep the volatility of the marketplace in balance with the need for&#xD;
    stability in building, fielding and supporting the solution in operations. Monitoring and evaluation begin at project&#xD;
    initiation and continue until the solution is retired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Topic4&quot; name=&quot;Topic4&quot;>&lt;/a>Increasing Stakeholder Buy-in&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While decisions are converging and knowledge is accumulating, the stakeholders must increase commitment to the evolving&#xD;
    definition of the solution. Since these stakeholders are a broad and possibly disparate group, this will be difficult&#xD;
    for many projects as this commitment is significant, even unprecedented. Active participation from the stakeholders,&#xD;
    however, is essential to the success of the solution. Creating an environment that includes the stakeholders (or&#xD;
    empowered representatives) directly affected by any change in user business processes allows quick resolution to&#xD;
    discovered mismatches between the available COTS packages, the desired user business processes, and the stated&#xD;
    stakeholder needs, while simultaneously demonstrating that the solution can be built within cost and schedule&#xD;
    constraints with acceptable risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    End-user needs mature and change with increased understanding of available COTS packages. The day-to-day involvement of&#xD;
    users is essential because the tasks that identify, evaluate and select COTS packages will shape the user business&#xD;
    processes and define the functionality that will be delivered. At the same time, architectural stakeholders ensure that&#xD;
    the COTS packages considered can be effectively integrated within the broader organization's existing systems to meet&#xD;
    required performance parameters. Business analysts must ensure that viable vendors support the COTS packages. Vendor&#xD;
    involvement can provide enhanced visibility into the COTS package's capabilities and potential insight for the vendor&#xD;
    into the organization's needs. The continuous negotiation and reconciliation among affected stakeholders leads to a&#xD;
    more effective use of COTS packages in satisfying the mission.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The stakeholders confirm and increase their buy-in and commitment to the evolving definition of the solution based on&#xD;
    an iteratively evolving executing system implementing the solution. An executing system is essential to reduce the&#xD;
    risks due to misunderstandings or unforeseen technical and operational factors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Topic5&quot; name=&quot;Topic5&quot;>&lt;/a>Process Framework based on RUP Evolution Cycles&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Across the life of a large or complex project or program, many generations of the solution, often overlapping, evolve&#xD;
    in response to new technology, new COTS packages and new operational needs. The four RUP phases are repeated for each&#xD;
    new generation (called RUP &lt;i>Evolution Cycle&lt;/i>), until the solution is retired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For instance, acquiring and implementing a COTS package could be done in a progressive fashion, where the final COTS&#xD;
    package solution is realized through a series of operational increments that advance the solution capabilities (see&#xD;
    Wideman's five white papers on Progressive Acquisition &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_cots-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_38304F32.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_1_bt0QiNEeCt4-FxrVeQpQ&quot;>[WID1202, WID0103, WID0203, WID0303, WID0403]&lt;/a>). Following the first development&#xD;
    cycle (first path through inception, elaboration, construction and transition) that produces the first operational&#xD;
    increment, each subsequent evolution cycle can be initiated with a new contract that focuses on the latest known&#xD;
    requirements, without having to invoke the full evaluation procedure that takes place in inception and elaboration&#xD;
    during the first development cycle. Instead, a simplified and more efficient version of the process is invoked.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
