    Abstract&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Building solutions based on pre-existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) packages is different from typical green-field&#xD;
    development. Numerous projects have unsuccessfully tried to integrate pre-existing COTS packages by defining the&#xD;
    requirements, formulating an architecture to meet those requirements, and then trying to fit COTS packages into that&#xD;
    architecture. The unique characteristics of COTS packages introduce dynamics and specific constraints that must be&#xD;
    accommodated. Projects that build solutions based on COTS packages require dedicated guidance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This paper will introduce the IBM Rational Unified Process for Commercial-Off-the-Shelf Package Delivery (or RUP for&#xD;
    COTS). The RUP for COTS is a configuration of the IBM Rational Unified Process, or RUP, that addresses the needs of IBM&#xD;
    customers who demand process guidance in their projects in order to evaluate, recommend, acquire, install, configure,&#xD;
    field, and evolve solutions based on COTS packages. In this paper, we will first introduce some best practices for COTS&#xD;
    projects. Then, we will define the foundations of the RUP for COTS. Finally, we will walk through each RUP phase of a&#xD;
    COTS-based project by introducing the objectives, roadmap, roles, activities, artifacts, and milestone of the phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The RUP for COTS is based on the Evolutionary Process for Integrating COTS-Based Systems (EPIC), which is a proven&#xD;
    methodology developed by CMU-SEI (Carnegie Mellon University-Software Engineering Institute). Specifically, the RUP for&#xD;
    COTS is based on EPIC concepts and principles (spheres of influence, iteratively converging decisions, accumulating&#xD;
    knowledge, and increasing stakeholder buy-in). In addition, the basis of some phase objectives, roadmap descriptions,&#xD;
    artifacts, and milestones come from EPIC.&lt;br />&#xD;
