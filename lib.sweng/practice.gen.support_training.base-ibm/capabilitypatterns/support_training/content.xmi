    <refinedDescription>This task involves an early assessment of the customer's business goals and job/task performance needs in order to identify&#xD;
the training and user support strategies that can best satisfy customer requirements. Technology-based strategies, such as&#xD;
Web-Based Training (WBT) or context-sensitive Electronic Performance Support Solutions (EPSS), are among the many&#xD;
strategies considered in the assessment. This task also involves developing a high level plan for the recommended approach&#xD;
that outlines the process, major tasks, schedule, skill levels, and estimated resources required to implement the training&#xD;
and user support strategies identified.</refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. It is recommended that the client&#xD;
    appoint one person to work with the consultant and to be responsible for all the activities concerning the development&#xD;
    of training material and the planning of the roll out.&amp;nbsp; This single point of contact will help the client:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant training a high priority, and get the best people on board, both for the development and&#xD;
            the training&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Have a chance to find the right people who are analytical and have the necessary skills and abilities to&#xD;
            develop or present training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the system or package well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they&#xD;
            have time to digest all the information&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check what the client's previous experience has been in training situations. Learn about the organization's culture and&#xD;
    previous reactions, and what works and what does not work in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development work must be carefully coordinated with the implementation of the Change Program. Changes in the&#xD;
    implementation should be reflected in the training material, and strict change request procedures must be put in place&#xD;
    to ensure coordination.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key risks should be presented to the client before the specification of the education material is completed. Risk&#xD;
    areas could include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Tools: Will the participants have the right tools on their desk when they have finished the training? Will&#xD;
            testing be successfully completed? Participants can quickly become disillusioned if they perceive problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Material: Has the material been targeted at the correct level? Are learning skills sufficient?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Time scales: Are the schedules realistic ? Has time been allowed for translating the material into other&#xD;
            languages ?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the training material is changed as a result of a change in the Change Program, in the middle of rolling out the&#xD;
    classes, consider using available communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and&#xD;
    where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what is the best way&#xD;
    of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it takes longer&#xD;
    than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.The planned lengths of the&#xD;

    The Education and Training Strategy consists of the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial list of critical success factors for training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        An initial roll-out plan for the delivery of education and training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy should address the following three major areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organization: staff must understand and accept new roles, responsibilities and competencies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process: staff must understand the business practices and operating principles associated with the business&#xD;
        processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT: staff must understand and be able to use any new package or system efficiently and effectively to perform their&#xD;
        work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify all staff affected by the change, training requirements for each, sequence of training, delivery methods, and&#xD;
    standards for success. The initial rollout plan should include the training of instructors, pilot classes and&#xD;
    logistical considerations.&#xD;

    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team&#xD;
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the&#xD;
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance&#xD;
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it&#xD;
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.&#xD;
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. It is recommended that the client&#xD;
    appoint one person to work with the consultant and to be responsible for all the activities concerning the development&#xD;
    of training material and the planning of the roll out.&amp;nbsp; This single point of contact will help the client:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant training a high priority, and get the best people on board, both for the development and&#xD;
            the training&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Have a chance to find the right people who are analytical and have the necessary skills and abilities to&#xD;
            develop or present training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the system or package well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they&#xD;
            have time to digest all the information&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check what the client's previous experience has been in training situations. Learn about the organization's culture and&#xD;
    previous reactions, and what works and what does not work in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development work must be carefully coordinated with the implementation of the Change Program. Changes in the&#xD;
    implementation should be reflected in the training material, and strict change request procedures must be put in place&#xD;
    to ensure coordination.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key risks should be presented to the client before the specification of the education material is completed. Risk&#xD;
    areas could include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Tools: Will the participants have the right tools on their desk when they have finished the training? Will&#xD;
            testing be successfully completed? Participants can quickly become disillusioned if they perceive problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Material: Has the material been targeted at the correct level? Are learning skills sufficient?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Time scales: Are the schedules realistic ? Has time been allowed for translating the material into other&#xD;
            languages ?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the training material is changed as a result of a change in the Change Program, in the middle of rolling out the&#xD;
    classes, consider using available communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and&#xD;
    where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what is the best way&#xD;
    of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it takes longer&#xD;
    than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.The planned lengths of the&#xD;
    time for training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Education and Training Strategy consists of the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial list of critical success factors for training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of the training needs for staff and the needs identified in other domains&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of alternate methods for delivering the training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An approach for the development of the staff training material&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial roll-out plan for the delivery of education and training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy should address the following three major areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organization: staff must understand and accept new roles, responsibilities and competencies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process: staff must understand the business practices and operating principles associated with the business&#xD;
        processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT: staff must understand and be able to use any new package or system efficiently and effectively to perform their&#xD;
        work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify all staff affected by the change, training requirements for each, sequence of training, delivery methods, and&#xD;
    standards for success. The initial rollout plan should include the training of instructors, pilot classes and&#xD;
    logistical considerations.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Interface Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications define the boundaries between the different units of user documentation, as well as:&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>Identify areas requiring user assistance. User support material is mainly task oriented, but is often supplemented by&#xD;
conceptual and reference information. Start with the detailed task descriptions and work flows. &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Using writing style standards and guidelines, develop the text, one topic at a time, documenting the step-by-step&#xD;
        details for each task. As required, supplement task-oriented information with conceptual or reference information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop realistic examples based on the user-task scenarios.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Incorporate well-designed graphic illustrations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop a comprehensive index to enable efficient information retrieval.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop a glossary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop appendices&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop preface, introduction, and other required front matter (such as copyright and cross-reference information).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sequence draft, adding transitions between topics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>To develop online help information, perform the same steps as above, except for adding transitions between topics.&#xD;
Also: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create links for hypertext.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create retrieval and navigational aids.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>For a users reference, focus on descriptive information. Develop concise descriptions of each topic, and sequence the&#xD;
topics to optimize the user's ability to retrieve information. For example, a command reference is probably best arranged&#xD;
alphabetically, while a message manual is usually sequenced by message number.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The user's guide and user's reference can be hardcopy, softcopy, or both. Consider that the optimal level of detail and&#xD;
formatting are different for the printed page and the screen. If both hardcopy and softcopy versions are required, the&#xD;
level of detail and formatting should be optimized for screen presentation.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Edit the user documentation drafts, and incorporate editorial changes. Develop user documentation iteratively,&#xD;
incorporating the results of walkthroughs and usability testing.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Determine what functional and technical information must be included in the on-line tutorial and determine the format of&#xD;
the tutorial. Perform the following steps: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the depth of the tutorial. Does the tutorial teach usage or concepts behind product functionality? Will&#xD;
        the tutorial be interactive or non-interactive?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specify the format and the development tool used to generate the tutorial. For example, will the tutorial be an&#xD;
        on-line movie script, CD-ROM-based, or a hardcopy book with a set of predefined exercises.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine organizational units of the tutorial. For example, will the tutorial be organized based on functionality&#xD;
        (what) or on usage (how).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop graphics and exercises to support the intent of the tutorial.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop tutorial text. Remember to partition text into small, focused units. Users read at different speeds and at&#xD;
        different comprehension levels. If an on-line movie is used, check the timing between displays to ensure that any&#xD;
        user can read and understand the text before the next text set is displayed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>Develop other user support material, which may include items such as: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Executive summaries&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Start planning and developing User Support Materials early in the product development cycle.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Involve the technical writing staff (information developers) in the requirements phase of the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Involve a technical staff member who has accessibility skills.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the User Support Materials outline with the&amp;nbsp;stakeholders at key&amp;nbsp;approval checkpoints.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that user support materials are created and tested for accessibility compliance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze who will use this material and in what situation when choosing the delivery medium.&amp;nbsp; For example: a&#xD;
        vibrant but detailed product brochure could be used for marketing and customer evaluation.&amp;nbsp; A planning tool&#xD;
        (as opposed to a book) might better help a customer determine how to install and configure the product.&amp;nbsp; A&#xD;
        hypertext help tool with a CD-ROM might eliminate the need for a hardcopy user manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a software product, the User Support Materials comprise everything shipped in the box other than the software&#xD;
    itself. Different User Support Materials may be delivered on different media, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Printed manuals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On-line help&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computer files&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hypertext&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Web sites&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multi-media presentations, including transcripts and captions for the audio&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Videos, including video descriptions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Glossy brochures, posters, and other user support materials may serve different purposes, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Guide: &quot;How-to&quot; or procedural information that provides mainly task-oriented information. If markedly&#xD;
        different sets of users perform very different tasks, it may be appropriate to produce separate user guides such as&#xD;
        an accessibility section that includes information on the accessibility features (such as keyboard shortcuts)&#xD;
        available.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Conceptual or background information (&quot;why&quot;). A separate concepts book may be required, depending on the complexity&#xD;
        and novelty of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Reference: Provides descriptive information (&quot;what&quot;) organized for quick retrieval. For example, a command&#xD;
        reference is organized alphabetically, or a message manual is organized by message number. A User Reference may not&#xD;
        be necessary. A well-designed index and glossary in the User's Guide may eliminate the need for a separate User's&#xD;
        Reference. Well-designed on-line messages, with links to help panels, may eliminate the need for a message manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Early in a project, consider providing alternate formats of printed material for people who cannot access the printed&#xD;
    page. Audio cassette, online, or Braille are examples of alternate formats that are available. Thinking of this&#xD;
    provision early in a project enables you to budget time and resources for the alternate formats.&#xD;

    Some information may appear in more than one deliverable. For example, the content of the quick reference guide will&#xD;
    most likely come from the user guide, reference guide, or help panels. The index items or glossary terms and&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. Appoint one person to be&#xD;
    responsible for all the activities concerning the planning of the rollout:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant education and training a high priority, and get the best people on board.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the plan well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they have time to&#xD;
            digest all the information.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the education and training plan is changed in the middle of rolling out the classes, consider using available&#xD;
    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team&#xD;
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the&#xD;
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the&#xD;
    same as they will use after going live).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If education and training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what&#xD;
    is the best way of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it&#xD;
    takes longer than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The planned lengths of the time for the training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business benefits of the initiative can only be realized if the user community is educated in the new systems and&#xD;
    processes and adopts the desired behaviors. Therefore the objectives of the education and training program are to&#xD;
    provide the users with the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        sufficient skills and knowledge to operate effectively in the new environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            support and encouragement to adopt the required behaviors and attitudes&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            well targeted and delivered education and training courses.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance&#xD;
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it&#xD;
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.&#xD;
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.&#xD;

    traceability to support completeness checking and change impact analysis without over-using the technique by tracing&#xD;
    &quot;everything to everything&quot;.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. Appoint one person to be&#xD;
    responsible for all the activities concerning the planning of the rollout:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant education and training a high priority, and get the best people on board.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the plan well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they have time to&#xD;
            digest all the information.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the education and training plan is changed in the middle of rolling out the classes, consider using available&#xD;
    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team&#xD;
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the&#xD;
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the&#xD;
    same as they will use after going live).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If education and training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what&#xD;
    is the best way of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it&#xD;
    takes longer than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The planned lengths of the time for the training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business benefits of the initiative can only be realized if the user community is educated in the new systems and&#xD;
    processes and adopts the desired behaviors. Therefore the objectives of the education and training program are to&#xD;
    provide the users with the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        sufficient skills and knowledge to operate effectively in the new environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            support and encouragement to adopt the required behaviors and attitudes&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            well targeted and delivered education and training courses.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance&#xD;
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it&#xD;
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.&#xD;
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;includes all training identified for all communities within the organization - including IT, process&#xD;
    and organization. Once identified these training activities are sequenced, prioritized, scoped, staffed, and&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. It is recommended that the client&#xD;
    appoint one person to work with the consultant and to be responsible for all the activities concerning the development&#xD;
    of training material and the planning of the roll out.&amp;nbsp; This single point of contact will help the client:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant training a high priority, and get the best people on board, both for the development and&#xD;
            the training&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Have a chance to find the right people who are analytical and have the necessary skills and abilities to&#xD;
            develop or present training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the system or package well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they&#xD;
            have time to digest all the information&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check what the client's previous experience has been in training situations. Learn about the organization's culture and&#xD;
    previous reactions, and what works and what does not work in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development work must be carefully coordinated with the implementation of the Change Program. Changes in the&#xD;
    implementation should be reflected in the training material, and strict change request procedures must be put in place&#xD;
    to ensure coordination.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key risks should be presented to the client before the specification of the education material is completed. Risk&#xD;
    areas could include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Tools: Will the participants have the right tools on their desk when they have finished the training? Will&#xD;
            testing be successfully completed? Participants can quickly become disillusioned if they perceive problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Material: Has the material been targeted at the correct level? Are learning skills sufficient?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Time scales: Are the schedules realistic ? Has time been allowed for translating the material into other&#xD;
            languages ?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the training material is changed as a result of a change in the Change Program, in the middle of rolling out the&#xD;
    classes, consider using available communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and&#xD;
    where the changes are.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Education and Training Strategy consists of the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial list of critical success factors for training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of the training needs for staff and the needs identified in other domains&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of alternate methods for delivering the training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An approach for the development of the staff training material&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial roll-out plan for the delivery of education and training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy should address the following three major areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organization: staff must understand and accept new roles, responsibilities and competencies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process: staff must understand the business practices and operating principles associated with the business&#xD;
        processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT: staff must understand and be able to use any new package or system efficiently and effectively to perform their&#xD;
        work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify all staff affected by the change, training requirements for each, sequence of training, delivery methods, and&#xD;
    standards for success. The initial rollout plan should include the training of instructors, pilot classes and&#xD;
    logistical considerations.&#xD;
