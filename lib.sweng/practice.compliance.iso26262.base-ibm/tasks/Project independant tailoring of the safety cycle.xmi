  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process of tailoring the safety lifecycle to fit in with the methods and practices of the organization. This means&#xD;
    that all the activities still need to be carried out but the phases in which this is done can altered or the activities&#xD;
    can be combined or split according to how the organization works.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an over-arching tailoring of the lifecycle and is different from tailoring the safety lifecycle during the&#xD;
    project phase as that tailoring is based upon the project and the item to be developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The exact details are given in ISO 26262 Volume 2, clause 5.4.5.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To tailor the lifecycle (if required) to the organizations processes and organizational structure</purpose>
