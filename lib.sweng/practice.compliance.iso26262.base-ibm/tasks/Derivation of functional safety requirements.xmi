  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The functional safety requirements are derived from the safety goals and safe states. They are decomposed to the point&#xD;
    where they can be allocated to an item subsystem, which is defined based upon the preliminary architectural assumptions&#xD;
    and the initial functional concept.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There&amp;nbsp;shall be at least one functional safety requirement for each safety goal. It should be noted that one safety&#xD;
    requirement can be valid for more than one safety goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The ASIL level of the safety goal shall be inherited by the related safety requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For detailed guidance on the derivation of these requirements it is advised that the user refers to ISO 26262, volume&#xD;
    3, clause 8.4.2.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity can be achieved in a model based environment is an adaption of the allocation of requirements from a&#xD;
    functional architecture to high level architectural design which can be based around subsystems, this process can&#xD;
    either be based around use cases and activities (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
