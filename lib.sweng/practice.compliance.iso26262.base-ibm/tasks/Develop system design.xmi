  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although the system design is not brought out as a work product in ISO 26262, it is essential to capture it for the&#xD;
    purpose of the refined system verification report that ensures that the proposed system design realizes the intent of&#xD;
    the technical safety concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The nature of the system design can be model based. This is an appropriate medium for a number methods that can be used&#xD;
    to verify the systems design which are recommended or highly recommended for according to the applied ASIL&#xD;
    level.&amp;nbsp;These methods include system design inspection, system design walk-throughs, simulation, and safety&#xD;
    analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a model based approach is developed further, with the appropriate tools it is possible that system prototyping and&#xD;
    vehicle tests can also be carried out.&#xD;
&lt;/p>If using model based techniques then it is advised that the following guidance is employed, use either &lt;a&#xD;

guid=&quot;_E9oWAa3hEd63sNXoX4A_sA&quot;>Architectural Design - Operation based&lt;/a>. These methods also provide the basis for&#xD;
deriving the HW-SW interface specification and the systems design specification.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
