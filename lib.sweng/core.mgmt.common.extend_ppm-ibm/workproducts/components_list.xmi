  <purpose>To support the organization in the definition and prioritization of components that are part of a portfolio.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without the Components List, the organization could have difficulty knowing what &#xD;
components are being carried out and what new work is coming to the various pipelines. &#xD;
This would significantly impact the organization's ability to align its effort &#xD;
and capacity toward those components that would bring the most value to the organization &#xD;
in achieving its business goals.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>When the portfolio is small (for example, fewer than five&amp;nbsp;components) or &#xD;
when stakeholders are all internal, decisions and communication about components &#xD;
can occur informally during planning and status meetings.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>The information in the Components List can be captured and maintained in a spreadsheet. &#xD;
Another option is to use a portfolio management tool, such as &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.default.tool_def.extend_ppm-ibm/tools/rational_focal_point_22FB1AEE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_YbyTYBS4Ed6MhpP9jJa1Mw&quot;>Rational &#xD;
Focal Point&lt;/a> to maintain components information and generate the appropriate &#xD;
reports required by the organization.</representationOptions>
