  <mainDescription>This practice is based on a technique known as the Weighted Objectives Method, developed by N. Cross [Engineering Design&#xD;
Methods: Strategies for Product Design, Nigel Cross, Wiley, 1989]. This form of analysis is commonly used to evaluate&#xD;
potential solutions to functional problems. It can also be used to determine the best hardware platforms for software or&#xD;
decide the optimum mechanical/electrical hardware split based upon non-functional requirements like a set of customer&#xD;
constraints, performance or cost criteria.</mainDescription>
  <problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main focus is to&amp;nbsp;understand and choose&amp;nbsp;the best approach to achieving a capability of a function in a&#xD;
    rational manner (for example&amp;nbsp;assess build, buy, re-use) and to apply Measures of Effectiveness as weighted&#xD;
    criteria according to importance like cost, safety to support elaboration of design concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main value proposition of this practice is to allow&amp;nbsp;stakeholders to clearly assess the merits of alternative&#xD;
    solution concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></problem>

    Start with the main workflow and go through each task in detail. Read the description of the central artifact of this&#xD;
    practice, the Trade Study Report, and its collateral material.&#xD;
