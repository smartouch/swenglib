    In order to identify the best solution from a set of candidate solutions, assessment criteria need to be identified.&#xD;
    Meaningful assessment criteria are established in collaboration with stakeholders and a team representing all relevant&#xD;
    areas of expertise. Typically, the assessment criteria are based upon customer constraints, required performance&#xD;
    characteristics, and/or costs.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not all assessment criteria are equal. Some are more important than others. Assessment criteria are weighted according&#xD;
    to their relative importance to the overall solution. The weighting factors are normalized to add up to 1.0. This task&#xD;
    should be performed in collaboration with stakeholders and relevant domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A normalization curve, also known as a utility curve or value function, is used to compute the measure of effectiveness&#xD;
    of a candidate solution for a particular assessment criterion. This curve yields a normalized value typically between 0&#xD;
    and 10. The input value to the curve is typically based upon equipment specifications or derived from calculations&#xD;
    based upon possible solutions. In this case it is considered as being objective. A utility curve may also be created by&#xD;
    knowledgeable project members. In this case the curve reflects the consensus among the group but should be considered&#xD;
    as subjective.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Measure of Effectiveness (MoE) describes how effective a solution candidate is for a particular assessment&#xD;
    criterion. The MoE is a normalized value computed using the utility curve and the nominal value specified for the&#xD;
    solution candidate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The nominal values are typically determined from equipment specifications or derived from calculations based upon the&#xD;
    relevant solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The assignment of MoEs to each candidate solution is a prerequisite for the identification of the preferred solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The determination of a preferred solution is performed by means of &lt;em>Weighted Objectives&lt;/em> calculations. In this&#xD;
    analysis the MoE values for each of the assessment criteria are multiplied by the appropriate assessment weight. The&#xD;
    weighted values for each alternative solution are then&amp;nbsp;added to obtain a total score for each solution. The&#xD;
    solution with the highest score is selected as the implementation for that particular aspect of the system.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, there&amp;nbsp;may be several levels of Stakeholder Requirements Specification - for example, in some cases&#xD;
    the Vision could be sufficient. In other cases, organizations may need to work with several levels of Stakeholder,&#xD;
    evolving the specification for the different levels. Typically, this&amp;nbsp;would include specifications such as&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;Product Vision, Product Objectives, Product Specification, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If more than one level of Stakeholder Requirement Specification is used, then remember the following points:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each document must be a complete and consistent description of the problem, at an appropriate level of abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Traceability must be maintained throughout the levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All documents must be maintained in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Frequently, it&amp;nbsp;is sufficient to evolve a single document. However, we recommend retaining at least the distinction&#xD;
    between the overall Vision and the Stakeholder Requirements.&#xD;

    This artifact captures the&amp;nbsp;conclusions and supporting data of trade studies performed to determine the&#xD;

    necessary input data for the next stage of analysis&amp;nbsp;in the process of determining the preferred solution&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact records information about relationships between information in the development. It is often a logical&#xD;
    rather than a physical construct. There is generally no specific physical &quot;place&quot; where all this information exists,&#xD;
    but it is distributed throughout the physical storage of the information used for development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The traceability record&amp;nbsp;allows those involved in the development of a system to understand the relationships&#xD;
    between different elements in the development, for example, which requirements are tested by a particular test case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where information is needed about the relationships between two specific types of information (for example Stakeholder&#xD;
    Requirements and System Requirements), it is often extracted into a Traceability Matrix.&#xD;
