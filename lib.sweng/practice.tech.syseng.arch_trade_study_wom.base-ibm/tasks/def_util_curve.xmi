  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A normalization curve, also known as a utility curve or value function, is used to compute the measure of effectiveness&#xD;
    of a candidate solution for a particular assessment criterion. This curve yields a normalized value typically between 0&#xD;
    and 10. The input value to the curve is typically based upon equipment specifications or derived from calculations&#xD;
    based upon possible solutions. In this case it is considered as being objective. A utility curve may also be created by&#xD;
    knowledgeable project members. In this case the curve reflects the consensus among the group but should be considered&#xD;
    as subjective.&#xD;
