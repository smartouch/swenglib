  <mainDescription>In order to verify/validate the architectural design model through model execution, for each of the system blocks at the&#xD;
lowest level of the architectural model the associated state-based behavior needs to be described in a statechart diagram&#xD;
(if needed these statecharts could be created for higher levels too). The derivation of the statechart is based on the&#xD;
allocated functionality (=operations), captured in the white-box activity diagram, the definition of associated port(s) and&#xD;
interface(s), and the associated white-box sequence diagrams.</mainDescription>

  <purpose>In order to verify/validate the architectural design model through model execution, the state-based behavior of each system&#xD;
block at the lowest level of the architectural design needs to be defined. In the case when more behavioral aspects need to&#xD;
investigated early in the process, these statecharts&amp;nbsp;could be&amp;nbsp;created for subsystems at a higher level of&#xD;
decomposition.</purpose>
