  <mainDescription>In order to verify/validate the architectural design model through model execution, for each of the system blocks at the&#xD;
lowest level of the architectural model the associated state-based behavior needs to be described in a statechart diagram&#xD;
(if needed these statecharts could be created for higher levels too). The verification/validation of the detailed&#xD;
architectural design is performed through model execution on the bases of stimuli derived from the white-box sequence&#xD;
diagrams.</mainDescription>
