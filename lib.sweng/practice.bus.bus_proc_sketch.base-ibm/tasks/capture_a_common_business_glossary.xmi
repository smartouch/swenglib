    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In business&amp;nbsp;process sketching&amp;nbsp;you must define a common vocabulary using the most common terms and expressions&#xD;
    in the problem domain. You&amp;nbsp;must then consistently use the common vocabulary in all textual descriptions of the&#xD;
    business. In this way, you keep the textual descriptions consistent and avoid misunderstandings among project members&#xD;
    about the use and meaning of terms. Document the vocabulary in a glossary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To find common terms in the problem domain, consider terms used when talking about what the business is about. Focus on&#xD;
    terms describing the following concepts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business objects representing concepts used in the organization's daily work. In many cases, a list of concepts of&#xD;
        this kind already exists.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Real-world objects that the business needs to be aware of. These objects occur naturally, and include such things&#xD;
        as: car, dog, bottle, aircraft, passenger, reservation, or invoice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each term is typically described as a noun, with a definition. Terms&amp;nbsp;must be in the singular, &quot;order&quot; and &quot;task&quot;,&#xD;
    not &quot;orders&quot; and &quot;tasks&quot;. All interested parties&amp;nbsp;must agree on definitions for the terms.&#xD;
