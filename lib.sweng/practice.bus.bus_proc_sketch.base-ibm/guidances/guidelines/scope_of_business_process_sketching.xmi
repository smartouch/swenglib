    A business process sketching&amp;nbsp;effort can have different scopes depending on context and need, and&amp;nbsp;can be used&#xD;
    for further analysis and the development and deployment of the business process. Six such scenarios are listed below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #1-Organization Chart&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You&amp;nbsp;might want to build a simple map of the organization and its processes to get a better understanding of what&#xD;
    the requirements are on the application you are building. In this case, business&amp;nbsp;process sketching&amp;nbsp;is part of&#xD;
    the software-engineering project, primarily performed during the inception phase. These types of efforts often start&#xD;
    out as merely charting with no intent of changing the organization, however, in reality, building and deploying a new&#xD;
    application always includes some level of business improvement..&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #2-Domain Modeling&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building applications with the primary purpose of managing and presenting information, such as an order&#xD;
    management system or a banking system, you&amp;nbsp;can choose to build a model of that information at a business level,&#xD;
    without considering the workflow of the business. This is referred to as domain modeling. Typically, domain modeling is&#xD;
    part of the software-engineering project, and is performed during the inception and elaboration phases of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #3-One Business Many Systems&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building a large system, or a family of applications, you can have one business process&#xD;
    sketching&amp;nbsp;effort that will serve as input to several software-engineering projects. The business process&#xD;
    sketches&amp;nbsp;help you find functional requirements, and they serve as input to building the architecture of the&#xD;
    application family. The business process sketching&amp;nbsp;effort is, in this case, often treated as a project on its own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #4-Generic Business&amp;nbsp;Process Sketches&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building an application that will be used by several organizations-for example, a sales support application&#xD;
    or a billing application &lt;span&#xD;
    style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;>-&lt;/span>it&#xD;
    can be useful to go through a business process sketching effort to align the organizations as to how they do their&#xD;
    business to avoid requirements that are too complex for the system. If aligning the organizations is not an option,&#xD;
    however, a business process sketch&amp;nbsp;effort can help you understand and manage differences in how the organizations&#xD;
    will use the application and will make it easier to determine which application functionality&amp;nbsp;must be prioritized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #5-New Business&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If an organization has decided to start a completely new line of business, and will build information systems to&#xD;
    support it, a business&amp;nbsp;process sketching&amp;nbsp;effort needs to be performed. In this case, the purpose of&#xD;
    business&amp;nbsp;process sketching&amp;nbsp;is not only to find requirements on systems, but also to determine the feasibility&#xD;
    of the new line of business. The business process sketching effort is, in this case, often treated as a project on its&#xD;
    own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #6-Revamp&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If an organization has decided to completely revamp their way of doing business, business&amp;nbsp;process&#xD;
    sketching&amp;nbsp;is often one or several projects in its own right. Typically, business reengineering is&amp;nbsp;performed&#xD;
    in several stages: envision the new business, reverse-engineer the existing business, forward-engineer the new&#xD;
    business, and install the new business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
