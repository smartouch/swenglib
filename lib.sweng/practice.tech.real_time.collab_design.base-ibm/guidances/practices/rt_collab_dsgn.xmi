    From the standpoint of this practice, analysis focuses on the essential and functional properties of a system while&#xD;
    design focuses on its optimization and deployment aspects. These design practices exist at three levels of concern.&#xD;
    Architectural design optimizes the system at a gross, overall level. Collaborative (also known as &quot;mechanistic&quot;) design&#xD;
    optimizes collaborations within the architectural. Detailed design optimizes individual classes, objects, functions,&#xD;
    data structures and types. At all levels, design proceeds primarily by identifying and ranking the optimization&#xD;
    criteria of concern, identifying design patterns and technical solutions that are consistent with the weighted set of&#xD;
    design criteria, applying the design patterns and technologies, and verifying the instantiated design solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Real-Time Collaborative Design (RTCD) practice optimizes an individual collaboration of elements, typically&#xD;
    realizing a single use case. Within a microcycle or iteration that realizes multiple use cases, this practice will be&#xD;
    repeated for each use case within the microcycle.&#xD;
