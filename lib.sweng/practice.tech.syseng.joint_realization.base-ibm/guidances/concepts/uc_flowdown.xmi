    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use-case flowdown is the technique for deriving functional requirements for the analysis (and then design) elements.&#xD;
    The results of the activity are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        survey of subsystem operations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        survey of hosted subsystem operations for localities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        survey of executed subsystem operations for processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        use-case survey for subsystems (optional)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The technique&amp;nbsp;starts with&amp;nbsp;choosing an architecturally significant set of use cases. For each chosen use case,&#xD;
    the flow of events is developed. This is the description of the interactions between the system actors and the system.&#xD;
    The system responses are black box; the descriptions make no reference to the architectural elements. Next, a black-box&#xD;
    step (which will be performed by a &lt;b>system operation&lt;/b>) is expanded into one or more white-box steps, each of which&#xD;
    is performed by a named &lt;i>sub&lt;/i>system. The white-box steps are also associated with the &lt;b>localities&lt;/b> which host&#xD;
    them, and the &lt;b>processes&lt;/b> that execute them. Each white-box step that spans localities or processes (that is,&#xD;
    requires more than one to complete) is split until it can be completed at a single locality, by a single process. A&#xD;
    white-box step can be replicated at several localities, but these are independent instances. These white-box steps are&#xD;
    candidates to become &lt;i>subsystem operations,&lt;/i> which are the equivalent of system operations at this lower level of&#xD;
    logical decomposition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The compositions of unique sequences of subsystem operations for an individual subsystem, participating in the&#xD;
    realization of system operations, yields the subsystem use cases (optional step).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Subsystem-Locality mapping&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the outset of use-case flowdown, you are dealing with a system which typically spans (and might even encapsulate)&#xD;
    several localities; the depth to which decomposition into subsystems (and sub-subsystems) is performed, is a matter for&#xD;
    architectural judgment, and depends on the domain and the complexity of the system, among other things. However, for&#xD;
    the purposes of performance analysis it is important that you understand the computational load to be imposed at a&#xD;
    locality, and this is done in terms of the subsystem operations hosted there. Therefore, consider the following&#xD;
    prescription for decomposition: the decomposition must yield a set of subsystem operations that cleanly partitions&#xD;
    between localities; that is, a subsystem operation does &lt;i>not&lt;/i> span localities, and if a subsystem operation (of,&#xD;
    say subsystem A) requires, for its performance, the use of resources at a different locality, then those resources must&#xD;
    themselves be made available through a subsystem operation, &lt;i>which might be provided by subsystem A itself at that&#xD;
    locality&lt;/i>, or another subsystem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This condition will obviously hold if a subsystem does not span localities, but a subsystem can span localities if its&#xD;
    operations can be partitioned as described-otherwise, the subsystem must be decomposed further. The discussion here&#xD;
    concerns single instances of a subsystem spanning localities; a subsystem can always be replicated at several&#xD;
    localities, but these are separate instances.&#xD;
