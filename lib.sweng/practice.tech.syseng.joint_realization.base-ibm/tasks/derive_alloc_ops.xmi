    <sectionDescription>Given the operations from the previous level of decomposition; some will be allocated in whole to one of the subsystems at&#xD;
the current level for each Viewpoint. For those, the operation will be allocated and assigned to the appropriate subsystem&#xD;
interface.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For those operations that aren't allocated, they are then defined at the lower level as a collaboration between the&#xD;
    entities at that level. This is done for the entities in each of the Viewpoints.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Elaborate the black-box flow-of-events text into sequences of white-box steps, which speak in terms of subsystem&#xD;
    actions and interactions. Next, a System Operation (black-box step) is expanded into one or more white-box steps, each&#xD;
    of which is performed by a named subsystem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that the analysis now proceeds driven by System Operation; that is, treat the next realization step as the&#xD;
    realization of each System Operation (rather than the more abstract notion of system use case black-box step). The&#xD;
    white-box steps for each System Operation are captured (initially) and associated with the corresponding System&#xD;
    Operation as its realization. The white-box steps are not stored with the System Use-Case, but can be traced from the&#xD;
    System Use Case through the System Operation.&#xD;
