    <sectionDescription>Working with the expanded (white-box) operation descriptions from the previous activity, the detail of messages, entities&#xD;
exchanged, sequencing, control flow, and associated data is added and the resulting Operation Realizations are captured in&#xD;
the System Model. As this detail is added, the System Designer evaluates the quality of the emergent collaborations,&#xD;
looking for opportunities to refactor the design. Annotate the Operation Realizations with descriptions of what the&#xD;
subsystem does when processing a message (drawn from the white-box step description and refined if necessary). These&#xD;
descriptions help with the next step, to develop specifications for each Subsystem Operation.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, working from the white-box steps and the Operation Realizations, the Subsystem Operations are identified and&#xD;
    their behavior specified. As with the identification of system operations, there might not be a unique subsystem&#xD;
    operation for each white-box step; that is, as you examine the set of white-box steps and their associated exchange of&#xD;
    messages, input-output entities, and so forth, you might find that it is possible to define a smaller set of Subsystem&#xD;
    Operations to fulfill their needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process allows you&amp;nbsp;to reason about concurrency issues: if you were to view a Subsystem Operation as a discrete&#xD;
    piece of functionality available to actors, then, as a first approximation, operations associated with the same process&#xD;
    cannot be performed in parallel. This might lead you&amp;nbsp;to reconsider the process allocation, or consider process&#xD;
    replication, or to examine the perceived latency problem at a lower level of detail, for example, through examination&#xD;
    of time-slicing options, and process sharing when an operation blocks (to do input-output, for example). These&#xD;
    techniques can give acceptable responsiveness, whereas a delaying of the start of an operation (strictly serializing&#xD;
    operations) might be intolerable. In this form, the survey sorted by process becomes a property of the System Model.&#xD;
