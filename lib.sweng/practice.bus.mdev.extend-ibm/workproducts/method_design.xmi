  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is an abstraction of the&amp;nbsp;authored method asset in terms of its composition (for example: plug-ins,&#xD;
    packages, configurations, and elements).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All elements are briefly described, and the relationships between elements are identified. All necessary variability&#xD;
    relationships are specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examine and explain the method asset so that key decisions can be made about its included elements&amp;nbsp;and&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;relationships between those elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Implementation of the method asset will proceed without needed analysis. This can lead to assets of poor quality that are&#xD;
difficult to understand, deploy, or reuse.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>If the method asset&amp;nbsp;is very simple, then documentation in addition to its authored definition&amp;nbsp;is not necessary as&#xD;
the design is visible in the definition.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>The format of the design is not as critical as the content. Use whatever format would enable you to communicate with the&#xD;
stakeholders so that they can understand the design and provide feedback. However, when selecting a format, it may be&#xD;
helpful to consider the downstream activities that may be able to leverage these materials (for example, enablement) and&#xD;
choose a format that promotes such reuse.</representationOptions>
