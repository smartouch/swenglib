  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business rule defines a specific constraint or invariant that must be satisfied by the business. Business rules may&#xD;
    apply always (in which case they are called invariants) or only under a specific condition. If the condition occurs,&#xD;
    the rule becomes valid, and must therefore be complied with.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Note that a business rule is declarative, not procedural. It describes a desirable, possible state that is suggested,&#xD;
    required or prohibited. It may be conditional, that is, if something is the case, something else must or must not be&#xD;
    the case. It does not, however, describe the steps to be taken to achieve the transition from one state to another, or&#xD;
    the steps to be taken to prohibit a transition. [BRG 2000 - Business Rule Group &quot;Defining Business Rules ~ What Are&#xD;
    They Really?&quot; Revision 1.3 July 2000]&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A business rule may provide a set of conditions that govern business behavior or provide the criteria for when an&#xD;
    action is successfully or unsuccessfully completed. It may stipulate what other actions can or cannot be performed as a&#xD;
    result of successful or unsuccessful completion. It may specify the response to some external event that impinges on&#xD;
    the enterprise. It may govern relationships that need to apply among various business entities.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>Business rules are intended to assert the desired structure of the business or to control or influence the behavior of the&#xD;
business.&amp;nbsp; They capture policies and constraints expressed by the business that need to be challenged and/or accepted&#xD;
as requirements.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If business rules are not documented, business people cannot validate them. If they are not identified as requirements,&#xD;
    developers may have to perform the analysis in order to understand them or they may instead build a solution that does&#xD;
    not comply with business rules. The rules are then likely to be represented directly in design artifacts such as code&#xD;
    and data structures. This makes them difficult to find and change when the business wants to adapt and change. The&#xD;
    resulting inflexibility has a direct business effect on business flexibility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Also, if Business Rules are not brought together in a single artifact, there will be no opportunity for identifying&#xD;
    rules that can be reused in different parts of the system or business. If reuse is not identified it is possible that&#xD;
    rules will be implemented that are inconsistent with other rules.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact may not be needed if there is already a Business Rules artifact that can be referenced or extended. If&#xD;
    there are no Business Rules, then the artifact is not required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules can be documented in a structured format as a text document or included as part of a model either as&#xD;
    structured text or using a more formal notation such as OCL. The benefits of formally modeling these in one or more&#xD;
    tools is that they are directly implementable with their related models, however this has the drawback that they cannot&#xD;
    be easily reviewed as a single set of rules.&amp;nbsp; It is for this reason that it is sometimes better to just use&#xD;
    structured text, which can either be maintained as part of a model for better traceability and structuring, or&#xD;
    maintained as a separate document that is referenced from the model which provides the convenience of a single source.&#xD;
    The various design models must then be validated against this single rules set to ensure that they appropriately&#xD;
    implement the rules as stated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Structured text&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    A term used to describe text that employs a variety of methods of presentation, such as tables and diagrams, instead of&#xD;
    sentences and paragraphs.&#xD;

    Selected Representation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Rules should be recorded with some level of formality. Different subject areas such as data rules, task flow&#xD;
    rules or legal and regulatory rules require different styles and levels of formalism. It is therefore not possible to&#xD;
    recommend a single selected representation. The Business Rules checklist and guidance should be consulted for&#xD;
    appropriate guidance.&#xD;
