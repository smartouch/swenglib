    <sectionDescription>If a particular transaction is too slow to meet your success criteria, then you must analyze why that is true and adjust&#xD;
something in the application code, the database structure, or the communication to the database back-end server in order to&#xD;
improve the transaction speed.&amp;nbsp; There are always multiple solutions involving deploying more or faster hardware as&#xD;
well as software changes to accomplish these improvements.&amp;nbsp; Based on the objectives and constraints on the system&#xD;
deployment plan and schedule, you may favor one solution over another.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Your testing schedule may have to be deferred, extended, or canceled and rescheduled based on how quickly the system can&#xD;
be re-fitted with the improvement.&amp;nbsp; Once an improvement of this sort is in place, it may be totally transparent to the&#xD;
user and the test or the test may have to be altered or even re-recorded due to the magnitude of the change.&amp;nbsp; The test&#xD;
schedule may have to be restarted at the beginning or more likely started from where you left off when you found the system&#xD;
bottleneck.&amp;nbsp; After getting a successful run at the 100% load point, you should be able to capture the test results and&#xD;
complete the test plan.</sectionDescription>
