    One of the most critical factors in the success of a performance test is goal setting. As the saying goes, if you are&#xD;
    not aiming at anything in particular, then you will surely hit it. Performance tests tend to have many stakeholders&#xD;
    that may not be obvious at the beginning of the project. You should ask the direct recipient of the project results who&#xD;
    else will be reviewing and approving actions based on the results of the performance test. Enumerate these additional&#xD;
    stakeholders and make sure their expectations are taken into account in the list of test goals. There has been more&#xD;
    than one performance test project that was restarted or have results rejected because it did not meet the expectations&#xD;
    of someone not involved in the formulation of the original project goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are some fairly standard goals for performance tests that you can use to start from to elicit a solid direction&#xD;
    for the performance testing project. Often several of these are the expected result by various stakeholders. You have&#xD;
    to explicitly state the goals that you are working towards as a way to set both positive expectations of what goals you&#xD;
    are planning to achieve as well as setting negative expectations of the goals you are not attempting to meet.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of performance test goals include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stress testing the application to prove robustness&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measure the overall system capacity in simultaneous user or transaction rate loading&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reliability testing of a given work load over a period of days or weeks to gauge an approximate availability metric&#xD;
        or a predicted mean time to failure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Response time measurement of critical transactions or user actions during a projection of the production maximum&#xD;
        work load&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Overload testing to characterize the system's responsiveness as the workload exceeds the system's capacity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Load range testing with incremental increases in load to show the system's sensitivity to changing load&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tuning, balancing, and optimizing the subsystems and ultimately the complete system to provide maximum balanced&#xD;
        system capacity for the lowest unit cost per user or transaction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By writing down the performance testing goals (usually as part of the workload specification) and reviewing them with&#xD;
    the stakeholders, you can begin your testing project with confidence that you can complete the project with a&#xD;
    satisfactory set of results and conclusions. Without this agreement, the pressure and scrutiny of high profile&#xD;
    stakeholders can make the project difficult if not impossible to complete successfully.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Performance testing is a very high profile and stressful activity as the decision making based on it can have major&#xD;
    business implications. By having everyone in agreement before the test results are reported, there will be less&#xD;
    opportunity to second guess the testing goals, approach, work load definition, or chosen metrics.&#xD;
