    Putting together the final report of your performance test project is very important to the long term value of the&#xD;
    performance test project. Recording each of the experiments, summarizing the test results, the analysis, the corrective&#xD;
    actions taken, and the post-tuning test results is crucial to growing the experience and expertise of the performance&#xD;
    testing capability of your organization. Maintaining a lab log that contains all of the system and software changes&#xD;
    introduced into the system during the entire project and the sequence of experiments can be beneficial from a change&#xD;
    control perspective and also in a complete understanding of the final state of the system that corresponds to the final&#xD;
    run for the record set of results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The report should also detail out the complete system configuration including operating system tunables, disk volume&#xD;
    layouts, size and characterization of the test database, network topology with firewall details, load balancers, and&#xD;
    complete specifications of the hardware and software versions present on each of the systems. Application versions are&#xD;
    critical to later understanding the use of these results as a baseline for future measurements or capacity estimates&#xD;
    based on these test results. Performance Tester reports can all be exported to HTML which can then be directly cut and&#xD;
    pasted into a final report. This makes getting the raw results and operating system resource data into the final report&#xD;
    a very efficient operation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Probably the most important part of the final report is the enumeration of the testing goals with the associated&#xD;
    success criteria as compared with the final test results. Stating clearly whether the system has passed the test goals&#xD;
    should be explicit and summarized. Putting these project findings in an executive summary at the beginning of the&#xD;
    report is recommended with the justification coming from the main body of the report. The final two sections describe&#xD;
    the conclusions reached by the project and recommendations for future work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As with any significant project, you should hold a post-mortem discussion with the project team members and gather both&#xD;
    the good practices to continue and the troubling one that have to be adjusted for a better experience next time. This&#xD;
    should not be part of the final report as it is an organizational and process asset rather than pertaining to the&#xD;
    project content.&#xD;
