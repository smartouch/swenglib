  <mainDescription>This artifact defines the services offered by the business in terms of interfaces and operations, the information that is&#xD;
passed around (business entities), the internal business structures (that is,&amp;nbsp;organization and business workers), and&#xD;
how they collaborate to realize the external behavior described in the business use cases. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This Business Model is used by stakeholders and business analysts to understand how the&amp;nbsp;business currently works&#xD;
    (in as-is form), and to analyze the effect of changes to the business (in to-be form).&amp;nbsp; The business analyst is&#xD;
    responsible for the structure and integrity of the model along with detailing the elements within the model.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    model is also used by systems analysts for deriving system&amp;nbsp;requirements based on how automated systems - that is&#xD;
    automated business workers (usually software-intensive) - will be used as part of the business process.&amp;nbsp; Software&#xD;
    architects use the model to define a software architecture that fits the organization seamlessly and to identify&#xD;
    classes in software analysis and design models.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Early design work generally begins with analysis and is abstract.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;analysis model is transformed into a&#xD;
    design model as abstract elements become more concrete.&amp;nbsp; For example the initial Business Workers can be&#xD;
    mapped&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;refined into human workers or automated systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business model captures both the analysis work and the design work.&amp;nbsp; This work can be captured in two separate&#xD;
    business models - the Business Analysis Model and the Business Design Model.&amp;nbsp;In larger efforts there can be&#xD;
    aspects of the business&amp;nbsp;that are still under analysis while others are being designed.&amp;nbsp; In this case the&#xD;
    business model contains both analysis and design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Business Model is to describe &lt;i>how&lt;/i> the business works to provide that which&amp;nbsp;is described&#xD;
    by the business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is essential when considering changes to the business processes or the organization (structure, roles and&#xD;
    responsibilities). You will be unable to reason about such changes without an artifact that describes how the business&#xD;
    operates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failure to produce this artifact increases the risk that software developers give only superficial attention to the way&#xD;
    business is done.&amp;nbsp; The result is software systems that do not support the needs of the business.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the objective of the business modeling effort is simply to &lt;em>specify&lt;/em> needed behavior (through Business Use&#xD;
    Cases), or to formulate a Business Vision, then this artifact is not needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;strong>Business Model&lt;/strong> can have the following properties:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Systems:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Components in the model, representing a hierarchy*.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Workers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>The Business Worker classes in the model, owned by the Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Entities:&lt;/strong> The Business Entity classes in the model, owned by the Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Events:&lt;/strong> The Business Event classes in the model, owned by the Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Rules:&lt;/strong> The Business Rules captured in the model. These are not the Business Rules that&#xD;
        are captured in document form in a separate artifact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Relationships:&lt;/strong> The relationships in the model, owned by the Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Use-Case Realizations:&lt;/strong> The Business Use-Case Realizations in the model, owned by the&#xD;
        Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Context Collaboration:&lt;/strong> The external realization of the interactions between the business&#xD;
        and the business actors, showing the &lt;em>services&lt;/em> provided by the top-level Business System (that is, the&#xD;
        business itself), the interfaces for these services, the connections to the business actors, and the Business&#xD;
        Entities input and output.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Diagrams:&lt;/strong> The diagrams in the model, owned by the Business Systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For&amp;nbsp;a more detailed description of different flavors of this artifact see descriptions of the artifacts contained&#xD;
    within the Business Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    *Note that the business itself is the top-level component (Business System), and directly encapsulates business&#xD;
    workers, business entities etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    UML Representation:&amp;nbsp; Model, stereotyped as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;business&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are variants for tailoring the Business Model:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Model, including only the domain entities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build two versions of the Business&amp;nbsp;Model, the current (as-is) and the target (to-be) model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build the target (to-be) model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build and maintain a&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;Business Analysis Model and a Business Design Model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build one Business Model that might begin as analysis and transforms into design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br /></representationOptions>
