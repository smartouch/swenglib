  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to re-engineer the target organization, consider maintaining two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Use-Case Model: one that shows the business actors and business use cases of the current&#xD;
    organization (sometimes called &quot;as-is&quot;), and one that shows the target organization with new business actors and&#xD;
    business use cases (&quot;to-be&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are considering a significant redesign of the way the target organization works (business re-engineering), this&#xD;
    separation is needed otherwise the redesign will be developed without knowing&amp;nbsp; what the proposed changes really&#xD;
    are at the end, and you will not be able to estimate the effects or costs of those changes. It is like an architect who&#xD;
    is asked to draw up plans for changing a townhouse into three flats, without having an as-is blueprint from which to&#xD;
    work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of maintaining two Business Use-Case Models is not insignificant, and carefully consider how much effort you&#xD;
    put into a current model. Typically, you would not do more than identify and briefly describe the business use cases*&#xD;
    and business actors. You would also briefly outline the business use cases you determine are key to the effort,&#xD;
    possibly illustrating this with a simple activity diagram. The level of detail you choose aims at providing a shared&#xD;
    understanding of the target organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You would not need this separation in the following situations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no &quot;new&quot; organization (the goal is to document an existing organization)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no existing organization* (business creation)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business actors in the use-case model are used by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>business analysts&lt;/b>, to define the boundaries of the organization and describe the interactions between actors&#xD;
        and business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>user-interface designers&lt;/b>, as input to capturing characteristics on human actors in the a system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>system analysts&lt;/b>, as input to finding system actors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>*Note: when modeling an existing organization to create an as-is model, you need to do little more than create the&#xD;
    brief descriptions of business use cases, business actors and key business events and associate these with the existing&#xD;
    business goals because you can move more directly to capturing actual current business processes that realize these&#xD;
    business use cases. The current business use cases serve as anchors to explain the purpose of the current business&#xD;
    processes. When the purpose is business creation, the new business use cases are &lt;strong>specifications&lt;/strong> for&#xD;
    achievement of the business goals, for a business that does not yet exist. Consequently, they will need much more&#xD;
    detail.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Use Case Model is used by stakeholders and&amp;nbsp;business analysts to understand and improve the way the&#xD;
    business interacts with its environment, and by systems analysts and software architects to provide context for&#xD;
    software development. The project manager uses this artifact to plan the content of iterations during business modeling&#xD;
    and track progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To describe the direction and intent of the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To aid in identifying the business goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To describe the interaction between the stakeholders, customers, and the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br /></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact, it is difficult to determine all of the relationships between actors and use cases. It is also&#xD;
difficult to gain an understanding of how different use cases relate to the organization as a whole.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact isn't required if the value the business provides is already well understood, the actors are identified&#xD;
    and documented, and the manner in which customers and the business interacts is already well defined.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
