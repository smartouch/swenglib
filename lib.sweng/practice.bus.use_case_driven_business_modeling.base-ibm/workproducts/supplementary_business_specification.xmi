&lt;p>&#xD;
    This document captures any descriptions of process, quantifiers or constraints that cannot be assigned to one business&#xD;
    use case. The contents of this document are therefore applicable across all business use cases. Where such quantifiers&#xD;
    or constraints apply to only one business use case, they should be presented as special requirements of that business&#xD;
    use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This document is read by stakeholders, business-process analysts and business designers in order to understand the&#xD;
    effects of these qualifiers and constraints on business design and by system analysts and software architects to&#xD;
    understand the effect of these qualifiers and constraints on software requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This document should not contain business goals, as these are identified, analyzed and modeled separately. Rather,&#xD;
    quantifiers and qualifiers that govern business use cases should be captured as supplementary business specifications.&#xD;
    Business goals are used to plan and steer the activities of the business in the direction of the business strategy,&#xD;
    while supplementary business specifications are used to define boundaries within which the business must operate. Small&#xD;
    or informal modeling efforts may be an exception to this rule, such as business modeling prior to developing a software&#xD;
    system. In such a case, the business goals may coincide somewhat with the supplementary requirements and may therefore&#xD;
    be captured informally as part of this document.&#xD;

    Adjust the outline of the document to fit the project's needs. The scope and depth of this work product depends on the&#xD;
    level of investment the project is making in building a business model. Most often, this document will be used to&#xD;
    capture constraints and restrictions applicable to business use cases. As an example, there may be regulations&#xD;
    governing the manner in which restaurants serve food to customers. These regulations will constrain the business use&#xD;
    cases related to serving meals.&#xD;
