&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use cases and actors interact by sending signals to one another. To indicate such interactions we use a&#xD;
    &lt;b>communicate-association&lt;/b> between use-case and actor. A use-case has at most one communicate-association to a&#xD;
    specific actor, and an actor has at most one communicate-association to a specific use-case, no matter how many signal&#xD;
    transmissions there are. The complete network of such associations is a static picture of the communication between the&#xD;
    system and its environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate-associations are not given names. Because there can be only one communicate-association between a use-case&#xD;
    and an actor, you need only specify the start and end points to identify a particular communicate-association.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/comasso1.gif&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A line or arrow between an actor and a use case indicates they interact by sending signals to one another.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Roles&quot; name=&quot;Roles&quot;>Roles&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each end of a communicate-association is a &lt;b>role&lt;/b> specifying the face that a use case or actor plays in the&#xD;
    association&lt;i>.&lt;/i> The roles are used to specify multiplicities and directions of the association (see below).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Multiplicity&quot; name=&quot;Multiplicity&quot;>Multiplicity&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each role of a communicate-association indicates the &lt;b>multiplicity&lt;/b> of its type, that is, how many instances of&#xD;
    that actor or use case can be associated with one instance of the other use case or actor. Multiplicity is indicated by&#xD;
    a text expression on the role. The expression is a comma-separated list of integer ranges. A range is indicated by an&#xD;
    integer (the lower value), two dots, and an integer (the upper value); a single integer is a valid range, and the&#xD;
    symbol '*' indicates &quot;many&quot;, that is, an unlimited number of objects. The symbol '*' by itself is equivalent to '0..*',&#xD;
    that is, any number including none; this is the default value. An optional scalar role has the multiplicity 0..1.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The multiplicity&amp;nbsp;can be augmented with a time unit constraint. This is&amp;nbsp;performed to state how many&#xD;
    instances&amp;nbsp;can be associated, possibly by different instances, during the time unit. This information is&#xD;
    useful&amp;nbsp;because it can tell us if the use case is performed often, and also how often each actor instance employs&#xD;
    the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/md_coma4.gif&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    The Conduct Transactions use case is used 400,000 times per day by Customers. Each Customer employs the use case two&#xD;
    times per month.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Navigability&quot; name=&quot;Navigability&quot;>Navigability&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each role of a communicate-association has a &lt;b>navigability&lt;/b> property, indicating who initiates communication in&#xD;
    the interaction.&amp;nbsp; Navigability is shown by an open arrowhead.&amp;nbsp; If the arrowhead points to a use case, the&#xD;
    actor at the other end of the association initiates the interaction with the system.&amp;nbsp; If the arrowhead points to&#xD;
    an actor, the system initiates the interaction with the actor.&amp;nbsp; Two-way navigability is shown by a line with no&#xD;
    arrow-heads (two arrow-heads tends to clutter diagrams).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/comasso2.gif&quot; width=&quot;446&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    The communication arrow defines the actor that initiated the use case. For each communication arrow the return message&#xD;
    is assumed. A line with no arrow heads assumes two-way communication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do not confuse navigability with data flow; i&lt;span>t is used to show initiation of communication only.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;
    example, a customer request for data is shown by an arrow to the use case representing the system, even though most of&#xD;
    the data flows from the system to the customer.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Communication from Actor to Use Case&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Actors communicate with the system by sending signals. To fully understand the role of the actor, you must know which&#xD;
    use cases the actor is involved in. This is shown by communicate-associations between the actor and the use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The multiplicity of the association shows how many instances of a use case one instance of an actor can communicate&#xD;
    with at the same time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In the Recycling Machine System, each time an instance of the actor Customer hands in a deposit item, he sends a signal&#xD;
    to the associated instance of the use case Recycle Items. When the actor is finished, the use case prints out a&#xD;
    receipt. A Customer can communicate with only one instance of Recycle Items. Thus, the multiplicity of the association&#xD;
    is 1. The receipt returned from the system is considered here as a response from the use-case instance; thus, the&#xD;
    communicate-association needs no navigability in the other direction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturecenter&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/md_coma2.gif&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A Customer who wants to return deposit items into a recycling machine will communicate with the use case Recycle Items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An actor communicates with use cases for many reasons, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To&amp;nbsp;start a use case. An actor instance always starts a use-case instance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ask for some data stored in the system, which the use case then fetches and presents to the actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To change the data stored in the system by means of a dialog with the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To report something special has happened in the system's surroundings that the system&amp;nbsp;needs to&amp;nbsp;take care&#xD;
        of.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Communication from Use Case to Actor&quot; name=&quot;Communication from Use Case to Actor&quot;>Communication from Use Case to&#xD;
    Actor&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One actor initiates a use case. However, once it has started, the use case can communicate with several actors. You can&#xD;
    use communicate-associations between the use case and the actors to show which actors the use case communicates with.&#xD;
    The association's multiplicity shows how many instances of an actor one instance of a use case can communicate with at&#xD;
    the same time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use cases communicate with actors for many reasons, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If something special has taken place in the system, an actor might need to know.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A use case&amp;nbsp;might need to ask an actor for help in making a decision if several options are available.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is common, but not always true, that the use case waits for an answer when it has sent a signal to an actor.&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;must be explicitly described in the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Optional Conventions&quot; name=&quot;Optional Conventions&quot;>Optional Conventions&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are common optional conventions which make it clear which actor initiates the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;span>The initiating actor-to-use-case arrowhead is always shown, even if the use case later initiates&#xD;
        communication to the initiating actor.&amp;nbsp; This is also the only actor-to-use-case arrowhead shown.&lt;/span>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;span>Arrowheads from use case to actors&amp;nbsp;can be omitted, or&amp;nbsp;can be included for clarity.&lt;/span>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
