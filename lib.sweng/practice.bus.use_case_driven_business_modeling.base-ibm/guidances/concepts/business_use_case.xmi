    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case describes the interactions between one of more&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw&quot;>Actor&lt;/a>s and the business in order to provide an observable result of value for the&#xD;
    initiating actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The functionality of a business is defined by different business use cases, each of which represents a specific goal&#xD;
    (to obtain the observable result of value) for a particular actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In an automated teller machine shown in Figure 1, the Bank Customer can withdraw cash from an account, transfer funds&#xD;
    between accounts, or deposit funds to an account. These correspond to specific goals that the actor has in using the&#xD;
    business.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Example&quot; src=&quot;./resources/fig1_atm_ex.gif&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; />&#xD;

        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business use case is associated with a goal of one of the actors. The collection of use cases constitutes all the&#xD;
    possible ways of using the business. You must be able to determine the goal of a business use case simply by observing&#xD;
    its name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case describes the interactions between the actor(s) and the business in the form of a dialog between&#xD;
    the actor(s) and the business, structured as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actor &amp;lt;&amp;lt;does something&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business &amp;lt;&amp;lt;does something in response&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actor &amp;lt;&amp;lt;does something else&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business ...&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each dialog of this form is called a &quot;Flow of Events&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because there are many flows of events possible for achieving the goal (for example, the flow can differ depending upon&#xD;
    specific input from the actor), and there are situations in which the goal cannot be achieved (for example, a required&#xD;
    business resource is currently unavailable), each use case will contain several flows, including one &quot;Basic Flow of&#xD;
    Events&quot; and several &quot;Alternative Flows&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Basic Flow of Events specifies the interactions between the actor(s) and the business for the ideal case, where&#xD;
    everything goes as planned, and the actor's goal (the observable result of value) is met. The basic flow represents the&#xD;
    main capability provided by the business for this use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the name implies, Alternative Flows specify alternative interactions associated with the same goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Closely related to business use cases is the concept of a scenario. A scenario is a &lt;em>&lt;strong>specific&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&#xD;
    flow of events, for a &lt;em>&lt;strong>specific&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> set of inputs to the business, states of the business, and&#xD;
    states of the business's environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Properties of Business Use Cases&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Name&quot; name=&quot;Name&quot;>Name&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business use case&amp;nbsp;must have a name that indicates what is achieved by its interaction with the actors. The&#xD;
    name can use several words to be understood. Note: No two use cases can have the same name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Brief Description&quot; name=&quot;Brief Description&quot;>Brief Description&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The brief description of the use case must reflect its purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Flow of Events&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Flow of Events - Contents&quot; name=&quot;Flow of Events - Contents&quot;>Flow of Events - Contents&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The flow of events must describe the use case's flow of events clearly enough for an outsider to easily understand.&#xD;
    Remember, the flow of events represents &lt;em>what&lt;/em> the business does, not &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the business is design to&#xD;
    perform the required behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Follow these guidelines for the contents of the flow of events:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe how the use case starts and ends.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, start every action with &quot;When the actor&#xD;
        ... &quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe only the events that belong to the business use case, and not what happens in other business use cases or&#xD;
        outside of the scope of the business being described.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Avoid vague terminology.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Detail the flow of events. Specify what happens when, for each action.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It does not mention actors who do not communicate with it. If it did mention other actors, it would make the&#xD;
        description difficult to understand and maintain.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you have used certain terms in other business use cases, be sure to use the exact same terms in this business use&#xD;
    case, and that&amp;nbsp;the meaning of the terms is consistent. To manage common terms, put them in a glossary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Flow of Events - Structure&quot; name=&quot;Flow of Events - Structure&quot;>Flow of Events - Structure&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The two main parts of the flow of events are &lt;b>basic flow of events&lt;/b> and &lt;b>alternative flows of events&lt;/b>. The&#xD;
    basic flow of events covers what &quot;normally&quot; happens when the business use case is performed. The alternative flows of&#xD;
    events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation to the normal behavior, and also variations of&#xD;
    the normal behavior. You can think of the alternative flows of events as detours from the basic flow of events, some of&#xD;
    which will return to the basic flow of events and some of which will end the execution of the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The straight arrow in Figure 2 represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative paths in&#xD;
    relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic flow of events, whereas others end the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 2: Typical structure of a business use case flow of events&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Both the basic and alternative flows can be further structured into steps or sub-flows. In doing this, your main goal&#xD;
    is readability of the text. A&amp;nbsp;guideline is that a sub-flow can be a segment of behavior within the business use&#xD;
    case that has a clear purpose, and is &quot;atomic&quot; in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions described.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Special Requirements&quot; name=&quot;Special Requirements&quot;>Special Requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements associated with&amp;nbsp;the business use case&#xD;
    that are not covered by the flow of events. These are non-functional requirements that will influence the business&#xD;
    design. See also the discussion on non-functional requirements in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Concept: Requirements&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;preconditions and Postconditions&quot; name=&quot;preconditions and Postconditions&quot;>Preconditions and Post-conditions&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A &lt;strong>precondition&lt;/strong> is the state of the business and its&amp;nbsp;environment that is required before the use&#xD;
    case can be started.&amp;nbsp;Post-Conditions are&amp;nbsp;the states the business can be in after the use case has ended. It&#xD;
    can be&amp;nbsp;helpful to use the&amp;nbsp;concepts of &lt;b>precondition&lt;/b> and &lt;b>post-condition&lt;/b> to clarify how the flow&#xD;
    of events starts and ends. However, only use them only if the audience for the description of the use case agrees that&#xD;
    it is helpful. Figure 3 shows an example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>A precondition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM machine:&lt;/strong> The customer has a personally&#xD;
    issued card that fits in the card reader, has been issued a PIN number, and is registered with the banking system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>A post-condition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM machine:&lt;/strong> At the end of the use case, all&#xD;
    account and transaction logs are balanced, communication with the bank is reinitialized and the card is returned to the&#xD;
    customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Performance Goals&quot; name=&quot;Performance Goals&quot;>Performance Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some common metrics to describe how the business operates:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time - an approximation of the time it takes to perform the workflow, or part of the workflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost - an approximation of the cost of executing the workflow, or part of the workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality - for example, &quot;no more than 2% of products are defective when they come off the production line&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A major challenge is to understand what scenarios are relevant to measure. Criteria to use are frequency of the&#xD;
    scenario, or business relevance of the scenario. If you can determine that a particular part of the workflow has&#xD;
    importance, you can save yourself some effort by only measuring the cost or time of that subflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Performance goals can be entered in the Special Requirements section of the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
