    This whitepaper provides in-depth instructions about defining business use-case realizations and business use-case&#xD;
    models. It closely follows the tasks and guidelines outlined in this practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Whitepaper Abstract&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As most software development practitioners know, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) excels at representing &quot;real&#xD;
    world&quot; phenomena. This capability led to development of the UML Business Modeling Profile, which provides extensions&#xD;
    and stereotypes to facilitate communication between users and analysts.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Organizations that are thinking about applying the UML Business Modeling Profile often have practical questions,&#xD;
    such as:&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>When do I really need a business model? When are use-case models alone sufficient?&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Which UML diagrams are used for particular business modeling situations? How do I know whether to use a&#xD;
        sequence diagram or a collaboration diagram, for example?&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>How does the UML business model relate to other UML models (domain model, use-case model, etc.)? How are these&#xD;
        models organized?&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Unfortunately, the literature that addresses these questions, as well as best practices for applying the UML&#xD;
    Business Modeling Profile, is relatively sparse compared to that for system modeling. This frustrates users and&#xD;
    analysts who recognize the benefits of using the UML for business modeling but are forced to struggle with the&#xD;
    notation.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>This article addresses their concerns by walking through an example case that models the acquisition process within&#xD;
    an IT department responsible for managing outsourced development. Comprised of legal advisors, enterprise architects,&#xD;
    and project managers, the department is responsible for contractual, system architecture, and project management&#xD;
    issues. Its mission is to free end-user departments from IT-related issues so they can concentrate on business&#xD;
    operations. When these departments need to acquire new systems or enhance existing ones, they get the IT department to&#xD;
    prepare tender specifications, and IT then selects suitable vendors to deliver the required system.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
