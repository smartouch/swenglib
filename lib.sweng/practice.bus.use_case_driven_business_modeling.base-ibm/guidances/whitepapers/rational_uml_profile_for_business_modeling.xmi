&lt;p>&#xD;
    This UML profile is a component of the Rational Unified Process&amp;reg; (RUP&amp;reg;). It presents a UML language for capturing&#xD;
    Business Models and is supported by the Business Modeling Discipline in the RUP. This profile is intended to enable UML&#xD;
    tools to be used in the area of business engineering. This involves diverse disciplines such as business information&#xD;
    modeling, business organization modeling, and business process modeling, as well as high-level concept and goal&#xD;
    modeling that act as the requirements for the activities of the business. This will form both a foundation for a new&#xD;
    class of UML tools and an interchange semantic between existing UML tools and other business engineering tools. The RUP&#xD;
    Business Modeling profile has recently been extended and updated to capture information regarding business context and&#xD;
    business processes. Early versions of the RUP business modeling discipline were intended for a very basic capture of&#xD;
    business information - just enough to understand the requirements for the development of an application supporting the&#xD;
    business. The goal of this update is to broaden the concepts and capabilities of the profile to capture more&#xD;
    information and more fidelity in the model. The Business Modeling profile is based on prior work by Rational Software&#xD;
    and Objectory, and is also used as an example profile documented in the OMG UML 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 language&#xD;
    specifications.&lt;br />&#xD;
