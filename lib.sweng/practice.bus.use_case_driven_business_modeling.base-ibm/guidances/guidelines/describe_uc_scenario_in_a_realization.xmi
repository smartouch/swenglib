  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Create a UML sequence diagram within the appropriate use-case realization. Identify the element (often a business actor&#xD;
    or business worker) that starts the scenario. Place that element on the sequence diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ask what happens first in the scenario. Who or what does the first element need to communicate with in order to perform&#xD;
    the first step of the use case? What needs to get done? There can be multiple operations that need to be performed to&#xD;
    realize a single step in the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Place the business element that the initiating element must interact with into the sequence diagram. That element might&#xD;
    already have operations associated with it. If so, see if one of those operations will accomplish what needs to be&#xD;
    done. If not, add a new operation to the element just placed in the diagram that will accomplish what needs to get&#xD;
    done. This is how you identify and document the behavior that the business elements must perform.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before creating a new operation, check other elements to see if they provide the necessary operation. If so, use them&#xD;
    instead of your first choice. It might be possible that the operation you're looking for is actually accomplished by&#xD;
    multiple operations across a number of business elements. Place those elements on the sequence diagram and call their&#xD;
    operations in the appropriate order. This might be a pattern the business repeats in many areas. Leverage these&#xD;
    patterns whenever possible. Business patterns can often be found in the business architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When it's clear that the sequence diagram shows sufficient behavior to perform the first step of the use-case scenario,&#xD;
    move to the second step and repeat the procedure. Who's involved next? What needs to happen in order to make the step&#xD;
    in the use-case scenario happen?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scenario has been realized when there are sufficient operations and interactions, in the proper order, for all&#xD;
    steps of the use-case scenario to be performed by the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
