    Business model elements (business components, services, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_worker_54116484.html&quot; guid=&quot;__uNa8VoGEd6Gvq_dRUXeQw&quot;>workers&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.bus.use_case_driven_business_modeling.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_entity_49738474.html&quot; guid=&quot;__uNa8FoGEd6Gvq_dRUXeQw&quot;>entities&lt;/a>, etc)&amp;nbsp;and relationships are defined from a global perspective, taking&#xD;
    into account external constraints (business architecture) and internal interactions (operations and behaviors).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Changing a single behavior in the business can affect the structure of the business at a global level. New or changed&#xD;
    relationships and operations are often introduced when a specific behavior is defined within the business.&amp;nbsp;It's&#xD;
    possible for inappropriate relationships or undesirable operations to be introduced. These need to be corrected while&#xD;
    allowing the business to perform the desired behavior. It's likely that relationships need to be evaluated and refined&#xD;
    to accommodate the new behavior. For instance, multiplicity or the direction of the associations might need to be&#xD;
    adjusted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Operations also need to be normalized across the entire model. Look for operations that are redundant or entities that&#xD;
    have similar descriptions or purpose. Refactor operations and entities to reduce redundancy, and illegal or&#xD;
    contradictory behavior.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Locate business elements such as business components, services, workers, and entities based on the the contents of the&#xD;
    use case model. Identify the primary abstractions used in the business such as roles, documents, job titles, and&#xD;
    deliverables. These elements serve as a collection of business elements used when the business behavior is defined. Add&#xD;
    the elements to the Business Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These elements are in addition to the architecturally significant business elements provided in the [Business&#xD;
    Architecture].&#xD;

    Assure the entities and workers have legal relationships that take into account constraints from the [Business&#xD;
