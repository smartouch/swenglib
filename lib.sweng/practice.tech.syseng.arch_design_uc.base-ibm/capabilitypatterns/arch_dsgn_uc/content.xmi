    An Activity Diagram is similar to the classic flow chart. It describes a workflow, business process, or algorithm by&#xD;
    decomposing the flow of execution into a set of actions and sub activities joined by transitions and various&#xD;
    connectors. These actions and sub activities are called activity nodes. An activity can be a simple linear sequence of&#xD;
    activity nodes or it can be a complex series of parallel activity nodes with conditional branching and concurrency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will be multiple instances of this artifact.&amp;nbsp;During requirements analysis, &quot;black-box&quot; activity diagrams are&#xD;
    created describing the functional flows for the system as a whole.&amp;nbsp;During architectural design,&#xD;
    &quot;white-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;activity diagrams are created that show the allocation of actions to specific system elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities may be grouped and assigned to objects - e.g. subsystems. In this case, the activity diagram is split into&#xD;
    swim lanes that depict the respective responsibilities.&#xD;

    The main type of elements used to describe the internal structure are system blocks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A System Block is an element of the structural description of the system under development. It is an encapsulated&#xD;
    entity, i.e. its communication with the environment is performed through ports and&amp;nbsp;associated interfaces. A System&#xD;
    Block may be decomposed into sub-System Blocks. At the lowest level of decomposition, the behavior of a System Block is&#xD;
    described by means of a statechart diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A System Block must have a defined boundary. Communication with the environment is performed via ports and associated&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Statechart Diagram describes the state-based behavior of a block. It is one of&amp;nbsp;the most important behavior&#xD;
    diagrams because&amp;nbsp;it aggregates the information from both the activity diagram (functional flow) and the sequence&#xD;
    diagrams (interactions with the environment), and adds the event-driven block behavior to the diagram. As the&#xD;
    &quot;language&quot; of statecharts is formally defined, the correctness and completeness of the resulting behavior can be&#xD;
    verified/validated through model execution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statechart diagrams are finite state machines that are extended by the notation of &lt;strong>&lt;em>Hierarchy&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    and &lt;strong>&lt;em>Concurrency&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Basically, a statechart diagram is comprised of a set of states joined by transitions and various connectors. An event&#xD;
    may trigger a transition from one state to another. Actions can be performed on transitions and on state entry/exit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most of the cases a&amp;nbsp;System Block Statechart Diagram&amp;nbsp;is defined for each leaf system block.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    emergent behavior that results form the collaboration of each leaf block statechart diagram&amp;nbsp;must reflect the&#xD;
    functional flow captured in the white-box activity diagram&amp;nbsp;as well as the associated&amp;nbsp;white-box sequence&#xD;
    diagrams.&#xD;

    A&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification is strictly the set of all relevant System Requirements for a project. This&#xD;
    set provides a complete and consistent abstract description of the solution to the problem represented by a stakeholder&#xD;
    specification or a similar artifact, and its context, at an appropriate level of abstraction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, there&amp;nbsp;may be several levels of&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification - for example, in some cases&#xD;
    the a single level might be enough, in others, the system must be broken-down into subsystems at various levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If more than one level of System Requirement Specification is used, then remember the following points:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each specification must be a complete and consistent description of the solution, at an appropriate level of&#xD;
        abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Traceability must be maintained throughout the levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All specifications must be maintained in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Frequently, it&amp;nbsp;is sufficient to evolve a single specification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The system requirements specification captures all of the system functional and non-functional requirements in one&#xD;
    place so that they may be analyzed for consistency, completeness and correctness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements must be clear, unambiguous, testable and complete. They must include all required properties of the&#xD;
    system. Care must be taken not to over-specify (a common problem) by including design measures in the requirements.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>         When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs
of all of the stakeholders are represented. In         particular, include
the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system
after it is delivered.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide
requirements and other requirements work         products. For example, the
authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements
within system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important
requirements are missed or duplicated, and that there is an agreed upon approach
for capturing and processing every type of requirement.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting
the source of the requirement is particularly         important when you separate
externally mandated requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying
a quality or desirable characteristic) versus         &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying
a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative
requirements.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either
through testing or some other objective evaluation.     &lt;/li>
&lt;li>         You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule
impact, and level of contribution to business goals.         Based on your
evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged,
defended, and amended.     &lt;/li>
