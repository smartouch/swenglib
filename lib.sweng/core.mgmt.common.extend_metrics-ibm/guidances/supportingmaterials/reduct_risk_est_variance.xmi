    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reduction of estimation variance is essential for meeting project cost and schedule commitments. At the beginning of a&#xD;
    project, cost, effort, and duration estimates are based on information available at that time. The probability of those&#xD;
    early estimates exactly matching actual results is not very likely except in the most basic of projects where the&#xD;
    problem space and technologies are very simple and well understood.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation variance describes the probability distribution of an estimate (cost, date, or effort), meaning how likely&#xD;
    the expected value is to be accurate. This variance is typically greater the further out into the future an estimate is&#xD;
    provided. As uncertainty is reduced in the project (e.g. the team learns more about new technologies that are part of&#xD;
    the solution and the scope of the effort), estimates become more accurate, and the team has more confidence in them.&#xD;
    The earlier in the lifecycle uncertainty is removed, the higher the probability the team will meet or exceed its&#xD;
    release commitments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation variance reduction is a key indicator of successful iterative development adoption. Iterations are planned&#xD;
    such that high probability, high impact and architecturally significant risks are addressed early in the lifecycle,&#xD;
    driving down uncertainty in the project. As risks are addressed, estimation variance decreases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation variance can be computed for any project variable (e.g. effort or cost) in a given iteration or phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each estimated element (e.g. work item, component), the team provides the following values:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Best Case Estimate - the most optimistic estimated value (if everything is perfect)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Expected Case Estimate - the most likely estimated value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Worst Case Estimate - the highest estimated value (if more things go wrong than right)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The amount of uncertainty is reflected in the difference between the Best Case Estimate and the Worst Case Estimate.&#xD;
    When the difference is low, there is a high level of confidence in the estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation Variance (for a given iteration or phase) = (sum of all Worst Case Estimates) - (sum of all Best Case&#xD;
    estimates) / Number of Estimated Elements&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Reduction of Risk Estimation Variance throughout the lifecycle is to use a trend line. Plot&#xD;
    Estimation Variance on the Y axis, and iterations or phases on the X axis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Ideally, estimation variance reduces over the lifecycle for teams focused on risk&#xD;
    management. 80% of estimation variance is removed in the early stages of the lifecycle (during inception and&#xD;
    elaboration phases) as risks (uncertainty) are removed. During the construction phase 80% of the remaining 20% is&#xD;
    removed. As the project progresses the&amp;nbsp;team's confidence in their estimates increases due to a better&#xD;
    understanding of the requirements as well as an increasing history of estimation data. The likelihood of on-time&#xD;
    delivery is high.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If estimation variance remains stable or increases, the team is not addressing risk. When estimation variance increases&#xD;
    during construction, it is likely that the team did not put enough focus on architectural risks. If estimation variance&#xD;
    is going down, but not by much, early in the lifecycle the team should focus on architectural and technology risks in&#xD;
    order to prevent problems later in the lifecycle.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    High level estimates are provided at the beginning of each phase, and refined at the beginning of the iteration (for&#xD;
    all work items planned for that iteration). Estimation variance is calculated for each iteration and phase during&#xD;
    iteration and phase milestone reviews to help identify trends. When the trend indicates a problem (for example,&#xD;
    estimation variance remains high late in the lifecycle) the team should collaborate with stakeholders to discuss&#xD;
    outstanding risks and to adjust project plans as necessary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work Item estimates are captured in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;. The assigned owner of the work item enters a Best&#xD;
    Case Estimate, Expected Case Estimate, and a Worst Case Estimate. A Schedule Risk Assessment report can be run at the&#xD;
    iteration level based on the variance in the estimates. A Reduction of Risk Estimation Variance by Phase report can be&#xD;
    generated with a simple spreadsheet tool, or a project planning tool that has attributes for the three levels of&#xD;
    estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimates will differ depending on the person who will perform the work. Estimates should be provided by the person&#xD;
        who will perform the work in order to be most useful for monitoring estimation variance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure that any tool used to capture estimate data is simple to use and does not introduce too much overhead to&#xD;
        the team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review estimation variance at the end of each iteration. If the team waits until the end of the phase, it may be&#xD;
        too late to make needed adjustments.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communicate key constraints and assumptions with estimates.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize risks and address based on likelihood of occurrence and impact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
