    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A central tenant of the agile approach to software development is that actual or potential users of software must be&#xD;
    involved in its development from the start of the development effort or, better, from the start of release planning.&#xD;
    Conceptually, user participation occurs during customer interaction sessions held at the end of each sprint.&#xD;
    Participants are given &quot;done&quot; code and asked to use it, evaluate it, and provide feedback. In practice, customer&#xD;
    interaction may occur at any point during a sprint as the team finds necessary to assist them in their efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Monitoring the kinds of stakeholders who participate in customer interaction sessions can help the team understand&#xD;
    whether they are getting the kind of participation they want and need.as well as the source of and perspective around&#xD;
    comments and recommendations received.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Customer interaction sessions are held to get answers to several questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have we developed functions that provide a high level of business value?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do these functions work well in the stakeholderâ€™s current environment?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What other functions might be developed that would be considered highly valuable?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What functions, provided now or considered for the future, provide little or no business value?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have any problems been identified with the function?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Several levels of detail are possible, depending on how granular the team and their management need the information to&#xD;
    be. Possible measurements include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total number of participants&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total number of participants, broken down into categories, for example the categories suggested by Kessler and&#xD;
        Sweitzer in outside-In Software development. &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                End Users - People who actually use the product, or who will use it when completed.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Partners - People such as external business partners who sell to users and therefore have an intimate&#xD;
                understanding of users and their needs.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Insiders - People such as internal surrogates for users who have frequent and intimate interaction with&#xD;
                customers and who therefore understand their needs.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Principals - such as project sponsors.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Count the participants in each category.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The metric is best displayed as a bar chart where the&amp;nbsp;X axis represents sprints and the Y axis represents the&#xD;
    number of participants.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select the categories to be measured. Total number of participants can be displayed as a simple column. Participants&#xD;
    broken down into categories can be displayed as a stacked column. Select the measurement pattern to determine whether&#xD;
    the total number of participants in all interactions will be counted or only those that occur in formal end-of-sprint&#xD;
    interaction sessions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    At the end of each sprint, &quot;count&quot; participants in the categories on the pattern selected, plot, and display.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Over time, the participation metric can be used to gauge the &quot;kind&quot; of participation the team has fostered. In&#xD;
    conjunction with other stakeholder feedback metrics, a picture of the effectiveness of customer interaction will&#xD;
    emerge.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Examine the percentage of participants who are actual users. A very small percentage (less than 25% might be a good&#xD;
    yardstick) suggests that while the output of each sprint is being evaluated, more evaluation is coming from interested&#xD;
    observers than from potential users.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Below is an example of a Stakeholder Participation report:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Stakeholder Participation report&quot; src=&quot;resources/stakeholder_participation.gif&quot; width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team monitors this report&amp;nbsp;at the end of each iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholder Participation data&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;collected in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;. The plan overview page is&#xD;
    used to collect unstructured information that applies to the iteration plan. This can include all of the Stakeholder&#xD;
    Feedback information gathered.&amp;nbsp; The plan overview section also provides a description of the high-level tasks&#xD;
    planned for a plan. You can include the following sections in the overview of the plan: Stakeholder Objectives, Notes&#xD;
    from the Stakeholder Meetings, list of deliverables for the iteration and the related Stakeholder feedback, Key&#xD;
    Stakeholder Meeting schedule dates, and stakeholders and other contacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Intended customer interaction activities should be planned during release planning and the plan used to assess&#xD;
        customer interaction effectiveness.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
