    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    New Development Labor Cost Percentage is a major IT financial performance indicator and is heavily influenced by&#xD;
    software operational cost factors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Method New Development Labor Cost Percentage = Application New Development Labor Cost / Total IT Labor Cost - where&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Application New Development Labor Cost = Total labor costs for new software application development/enhancement across&#xD;
    the entire IT organization. Cost should be quantified in terms of currency (e.g., dollars).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Total IT Labor Cost = Total labor costs for the entire IT organization. Cost should be quantified in terms of currency&#xD;
    (e.g., dollars).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    New Development Labor Cost Percentage provides an indication of the organization's ability to meet the needs of the&#xD;
    business through software innovation. Rendered as a percentage, this metric facilitates trend charting and comparisons&#xD;
    from period to period to determine performance over time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The target New Development Labor Cost Percentage is highly dependent upon the degree innovation required by the&#xD;
    business and the application technologies and environments. The optimal value is set by IT management but must be&#xD;
    evaluated in the context of overall business needs and financial constraints. However, it is generally desirable to&#xD;
    increase new development investment as long as it does not also drive up the cost of application maintenance.&#xD;
