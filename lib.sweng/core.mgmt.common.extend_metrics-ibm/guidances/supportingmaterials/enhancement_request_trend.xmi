    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although defects typically indicate a problem with code, in that the software is not working the way it is supposed to&#xD;
    according to the specified requirements, enhancement requests indicate that the software is not working the way the&#xD;
    stakeholders want it to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Distinguishing between the two is essential to understanding what corrective action&#xD;
    might be required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Enhancement Request Trend metric is used to monitor the trend of stakeholder enhancement requests throughout the&#xD;
    project lifecycle. When an enhancement request is submitted, it might or might not be approved based on potential&#xD;
    impact to the project schedule. Therefore, the team must investigate the criticality of implementing each request as&#xD;
    well as the impact on the project schedule if the request is approved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric helps the team adjust the project plan and details, such as the iteration plan, as enhancement requests are&#xD;
    submitted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total number of submitted enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total number of approved enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total number of resolved enhancement requests&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor Enhancement Request Trend over time is to use a trend line. The number of enhancements is plotted&#xD;
    on the Y axis, and the iterations are on the X axis. It can be useful to categorize the requests by criticality (low,&#xD;
    medium, high).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Using Enhancement Request Trend to monitor project execution&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Enhancement requests are expected during the lifecycle. They indicate that the team has communicated with the&#xD;
    stakeholders and that feedback has been received for improvement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Enhancement Request Trend is used as a project execution metric to help a team monitor and steer its project&#xD;
    performance. As enhancement requests are tracked, trends are identified to help the team understand&amp;nbsp;whether they&#xD;
    are delivering what the stakeholders need and expect. If the number of enhancement requests is too high, without&#xD;
    indications from trends that the number is decreasing, the team can take appropriate corrective action.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Ideally, the number of enhancement requests is low throughout the lifecycle or&#xD;
    decreasing as the project progresses. This indicates that stakeholders are receiving expected value from&amp;nbsp;iteration&#xD;
    to iteration as the team delivers working software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High number of enhancement requests throughout the lifecycle&lt;/strong> - A high number of enhancement requests&#xD;
    can indicate that there is a high risk of requirements churn, or that there are issues with the understanding of&#xD;
    project requirements among stakeholders, or between stakeholders and the team. Ensure that the team is releasing&#xD;
    working software in each iteration, requesting feedback, and taking action on that feedback. Collaborate with&#xD;
    stakeholders to clarify and refine requirements in order to ensure a shared understanding. This trend can also indicate&#xD;
    that management and/or stakeholders required detailed plans at project initiation instead of performing high-level&#xD;
    planning followed by detailed iteration planning as the project progresses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Dramatic increase at the end of the lifecycle&lt;/strong> - This trend can occur when stakeholders are not&#xD;
    providing regular feedback to the team, and wait until the end of the lifecycle to review the solution. It can also&#xD;
    occur when the team waits until the end of the lifecycle to address high risk items, not allowing enough time to&#xD;
    clarify or resolve open issues. When this occurs, collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize remaining features and&#xD;
    requests. If the number of enhancement requests is higher than can be addressed in the current release, postpone all&#xD;
    non-critical requests to the next release.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following graph shows an example of Enhancement Request Trend monitoring by iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The chart below is an example of Enhancement Request Trends chart from IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight&amp;reg;. In this chart, the high&#xD;
    number of enhancement requests is at the bottom represented by the red column, medium in the middle with the yellow&#xD;
    column, and low at the top with blue column.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enhancement Request Trend Report&quot; src=&quot;./resources/enhance_req_trend_insight.gif&quot; width=&quot;380&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;362&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Using Enhancement Request Trend to monitor capability improvement&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Enhancement Request Trend is also used as a capability improvement metric. It helps a team and middle management&#xD;
    (project manager, product owner) monitor improvements made during the project lifecycle in adopting the Release&#xD;
    Planning practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If teams are successfully adopting this practice by creating a strategic release plan as well as tactical iteration&#xD;
    plans within each release, and updating plans as often as necessary to reflect changing business priorities and&#xD;
    needs,&amp;nbsp;that will be reflected in their Enhancement Request Trends. Operational executives can also use this metric&#xD;
    to monitor systematic improvement in increasing value across the organization by adopting this practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Projects will have a low number of enhancement requests, that decrease as the project&#xD;
    progresses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High number of enhancement requests&lt;/strong> - If projects routinely have a high number of enhancement&#xD;
    requests, ensure that management and stakeholders are not requiring teams to produce detailed project plans and&#xD;
    specifications up front.&amp;nbsp;Emphasize best practices of Release Planning to balance high-level and just-in-time&#xD;
    low-level planning.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data is collected throughout the lifecycle as requests are submitted, approved, and resolved. The resulting Enhancement&#xD;
    Request Trend chart is shown by a team lead or project manager for review by the team and stakeholders at the end of&#xD;
    each iteration to help identify trends and to take action based on findings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Enhancement Request Trends for multiple projects can be rolled up quarterly in order to monitor improvement across the&#xD;
    organization.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ClearQuest&amp;reg; collects enhancement requests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight&amp;reg; reports on this metric.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enhancement requests are submitted by&amp;nbsp;using a consistent and well-defined process, using a tool that is easily&#xD;
        accessible to stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The product owner maintains a product backlog that is prioritized and updated as necessary to reflect changing&#xD;
        stakeholder needs and priorities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Release planning creates&amp;nbsp;a coarse-grained, high-level plan, with low-level plans defined for each iteration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Working software is delivered in time-boxed iterations and frequent stakeholder feedback is received&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It can be difficult to distinguish between defects and enhancement requests.&amp;nbsp;Nonetheless, it is important to&#xD;
        draw the distinction in order to determine what is taking up more of the team's time, so that&amp;nbsp;you can take&#xD;
        the&amp;nbsp;appropriate corrective actions. If there are too many defects, the team might need to implement more&#xD;
        automated testing, adopt test-driven development, or devote more time to peer reviews. If there are too many&#xD;
        enhancement requests, the team might need to do a better job of eliciting requirements or requesting stakeholder&#xD;
        feedback. Often, the development team becomes frustrated when requests are filed as defects that they believe are&#xD;
        actually enhancement requests. They feel that it reflects poorly on their work, as opposed to simply being a new&#xD;
        requirement. However, the customer is not as concerned with the distinction. To them, both types of requests&#xD;
        represent work that must be done to satisfy their needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider project size and effort when determining if there are a high number of enhancement requests.&#xD;
        Base&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;targets on previous successful and troubled projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the project consistently has a low number of enhancement requests logged, use the Customer Satisfaction metric&#xD;
        as a countermeasure. Stakeholders might not be submitting enhancement requests, but may be voicing concerns in&#xD;
        feedback surveys.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
