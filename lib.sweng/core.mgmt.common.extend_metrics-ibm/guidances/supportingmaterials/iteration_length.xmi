    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective of this metric is to measure the length of iterations in a project. The software development lifecycle is&#xD;
    divided into various iterations in order to be completed. Each iteration has a fixed duration, or a time-box. In most&#xD;
    projects, the iterations length varies from four weeks to six weeks based on the size and complexity of project and&#xD;
    work assigned to the iteration. If the planned iteration length is longer than six weeks, this would need a&#xD;
    justification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recommended iteration length is four weeks. This iteration length is typically long enough to allow work increments&#xD;
    to be started and finished within an iteration, and at the same time is short enough to allow for setting up&#xD;
    expectations from stakeholders that new functionality is added and available in a sustained, incremental manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Total number of weeks planned for each iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The measurement analysis helps us understand if the length of project iterations&amp;nbsp;is stabilizing successfully.&#xD;
    Having stable, same length iterations makes it easier for teams to use other project and iteration metrics more&#xD;
    efficiently and effectively, such as iteration burndown metric, iteration velocity metric, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generally, historical data is used for planning the iterations length in the beginning of the project. However,&#xD;
    iterations length can be further adjusted based on current iteration situation and needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following figure shows a sample graph with plotted iterations length.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this graph, the length of the first two iterations is three weeks, because of factors like quick turn around&#xD;
    capturing the requirements and creating initial design and implementation. Later in the project, when there are&#xD;
    activities related to development, testing, review (with potential rework) and release, one more week is added to the&#xD;
    typical iteration length, making iterations to be four weeks long.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Iteration length is reviewed by the team at the end of the iteration as part of the retrospective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;

    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;collects data for this metric.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
