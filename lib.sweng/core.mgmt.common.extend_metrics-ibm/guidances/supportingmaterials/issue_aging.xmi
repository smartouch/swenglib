    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Issue Aging is a measurement of team capacity and process efficiency. Teams monitor Issue Aging in order to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        determine whether issues are being addressed in a timely manner&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        understand the capacity of the team to resolve past issues to help with future planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        determine if there is a problem with high severity, critical issues taking too long to fix&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Count the number of days it takes for each issue to move to the next state (e.g. Submitted to Assigned, Assigned to&#xD;
    Resolved, and Resolved to Closed) and categorize by age group (e.g. less than 5 days, 5 to 10 days, and more than 10&#xD;
    days).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    For each state (e.g. Submitted to Assigned) in each age group (e.g. 5 to 10 days), calculate&amp;nbsp;a percentage by&#xD;
    dividing the number of issues in that state in that age group by the total number of issue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Teams typically set up acceptable thresholds for the number of days it should take to solve issues, and later use these&#xD;
    thresholds to assess the performance of the issue management process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a bar chart to monitor Issue aging. Plot the percentage of issue group on the Y axis, and the issue state group&#xD;
    grouped by age group on the X axis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The Issue Aging graph should be updated in every iteration. So, the percentage of each issue group should be the&#xD;
    cumulative number of issues, not only the number of issues in the current iteration.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected Trend&lt;/strong> - Early in the lifecycle, with uncertainties such as project scope and resource&#xD;
    allocation, it is typical to take longer to solve issues. As the project progresses, uncertainties are reduced,&#xD;
    resources stabilize, and the team has a better understanding of the project, the team should get better at resolving&#xD;
    issues. Hence, the issues will take less time to drive to closure and the team should expect fewer of them.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High percentage of issues in the high age group&lt;/strong> (e.g. more-than-10-days) - Generally, this signifies&#xD;
    that the team does not address issues in a timely manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High percentage of Submitted to Assigned issues&lt;/strong> - When an issue is not promptly assigned, either&#xD;
    analysis is taking too long, or the team is not placing high enough priority on reviewing submitted issues. Confirm&#xD;
    there is sufficient, consistent process and tooling in place that will alert the team to newly submitted issues and&#xD;
    that necessary information is captured with each report for efficient analysis. Confirm the team works to move&#xD;
    submissions through the process as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High percentage of Assigned to Resolved issues&lt;/strong> - This can occur when low priority is placed by the&#xD;
    team on resolving issues. Or, the issue is very complex and needs a lot of time to negotiate, reach a decision or solve&#xD;
    the issue. An issue that is found late the in lifecycle is usually more difficult to solve, since various foundations&#xD;
    may be developed based upon it, and correcting the issue may have larger impact throughout the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High percentage of Resolved to Closed issues&lt;/strong> - Once the issue is solved, it has to be validated and&#xD;
    verified to ensure that the issue is solved correctly and completely. Some issues may be more challenging than others.&#xD;
    But, a large number of resolved issues that are not closed usually implies that these issues have low priority or the&#xD;
    team fails to react responsively.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Below is an example Issue Aging chart.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team has a tool in place to collect issue data, and has identified states for measurement&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issue status updates are collected with date stamps&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data is harvested for reporting purposes before the end of each iteration. The team reviews Issue Aging during their&#xD;
    iteration assessment meetings.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Project Conductor&amp;reg; and IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg; collect Issue Aging Data. IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight&amp;reg;&#xD;
    reports on this metric.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The team has a tool in place to collect issue data, and has identified states for measurement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issue status updates are collected with date stamps&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    • Issues may be in some states more than once. Combine the number of days with the previous time they were in that&#xD;
    state. Confirm the tool used accounts for this.&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Priority of issues should be considered when setting target average issue Aging for each state.&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Unmanageable risks turn into issues, so a good risk management process is also required&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Issues should be discussed in daily meetings and in iteration assessments.&lt;br />&#xD;
