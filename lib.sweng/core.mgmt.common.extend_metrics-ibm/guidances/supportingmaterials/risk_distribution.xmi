    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Risk is a concern that has some probability of negatively impacting release commitments (such as schedule and cost) or&#xD;
    the quality of the solution. Addressing risks associated with project elements such as use cases or components&#xD;
    according to their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact is essential for project health.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Monitoring risk distribution provides several benefits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Drives iteration plans. Use Cases and components that have associated risk with the highest probability of&#xD;
        occurring and highest potential impact should be implemented first.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provides an easily understood summary of risk exposure for each element that could impact project success. New and&#xD;
        escalating risks are visible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduces the likelihood of focusing on the wrong issues early in the lifecycle that can result in large surprises at&#xD;
        the end of the project. Encourages ongoing and active mitigation efforts and increased communication.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Useful for explaining the team's confidence in their estimates based on remaining uncertainty. Helps describe the&#xD;
        predictability of the project based on remaining risk.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Helps the team understand the effectiveness of their risk mitigation activities&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To calculate Risk Distribution:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze risk and assign the following values to each project element (e.g. use case, component)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
            Likelihood of occurrence - defined as a percentage. Use a standard scale such as 20% (low likelihood of&#xD;
            occurrence), 40%, 60%, 80% (high likelihood of occurrence)&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
            Estimated Cost of Impact - defined in hours or days&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. Calculate a risk exposure score for each project element&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risk Score = Likelihood of occurrence * Estimated Cost of Impact&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generate a Risk Distribution report prior to iteration planning. Identify&amp;nbsp;project elements&amp;nbsp;with the highest&#xD;
    risk scores and determine what activities are required (for example:&amp;nbsp;get clarification from stakeholders in order&#xD;
    to detail those use cases and address any uncertainties). If Risk Distribution is based on components, identify those&#xD;
    with the highest risk scores in order to prioritize architectural analysis efforts to make sure those solution&#xD;
    components can work as needed to meet stakeholders needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Risk Distribution report is reviewed in each iteration planning session. The team should adjust risk levels at the&#xD;
    end of each iteration during a retrospective meeting. Risk Scores are adjusted as needed, and risks that have been&#xD;
    addressed are closed so that the team can update the Risk Distribution chart. Stakeholders are routinely apprised of&#xD;
    current risks and collaborate with the team for impact assessment and mitigation.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risks can be captured in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;,&amp;nbsp;IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Project Conductor&amp;reg;,&amp;nbsp;or in a simple&#xD;
    spreadsheet. Generate the Risk Distribution chart using custom reporting capabilities of Rational tools or&amp;nbsp;using&#xD;
    charting capabilities in a basic spreadsheet tool.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risks are captured, and the team collaborates with stakeholders to determine likelihood and impact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If risk is not managed consistently throughout the lifecycle, the team will likely begin to act in a reactive,&#xD;
        crisis mode as risks emerge. A consistent, repeatable risk mitigation process enables better project predictability&#xD;
        and higher levels of trust by project stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The need to identify and monitor risk increases with the complexity of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The effort to reduce uncertainty has an associated cost. The team must balance the cost of this effort against the&#xD;
        potential impact of not addressing the risk. Not all candidate risks are actively managed. Mitigation effort and&#xD;
        degree of monitoring depend on the likelihood of impact and the risk tolerance for the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_metrics-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/reduct_risk_est_variance_BB6D6664.html&quot; guid=&quot;_qxjBcOEWEd6AqdnazgLzJg&quot;>Reduction of Risk Estimation Variance&lt;/a> metric can be used with Risk Distribution&#xD;
        to monitor trends in reducing risk throughout the lifecycle.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
