    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Net Present Value (NPV) is a valuable tool for instrumenting incomplete development efforts, including IT projects. It&#xD;
    can be used to assess the value of continuing a project, understanding if it has added value to date, weighing its&#xD;
    value relative to other projects, and trading between various different means by which the project might be finished.&#xD;
    NPV provides a meaningful alternative to the conventional wisdom that an effort has no value until it ships, by&#xD;
    objectively acknowledging work already done and providing a basis for ongoing value management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NPV = the distribution empirically derived from the sum of all random variables characterizing monetary benefits&#xD;
    expected over time, minus the sum of all random variables characterizing expected costs over time. This is not a&#xD;
    trivial calculation, but it is straightforward. Note that it results in a distribution, not a single number, though one&#xD;
    commonly uses the mean and standard deviation - two numbers - to characterize the result. A benefit of its use is that&#xD;
    the standard deviation is a highly appropriate measure of uncertainty or risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The calculation uses streams of distributions for benefits and costs, an appropriate discount rate representing that&#xD;
    future money is worth less, and Monte Carlo simulation to permit arithmetic on these streams of distributions. While it&#xD;
    is not necessary to divide the streams any further than benefits and costs, we have found it appropriate to do so due&#xD;
    to the various classes of stakeholders typically found in larger IT organizations, who know about some types of&#xD;
    benefits or costs, but not others. Thus, a common formulation accounts for mission effectiveness benefits and&#xD;
    operational effectiveness (efficiency) benefits separately. Similarly, costs are divided into direct development costs,&#xD;
    integration costs, and costs of ownership such as maintenance activities. In this formulation, the NPV is the&#xD;
    distribution of the following formula:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    where:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IV = Investment value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        MEi = Revenue or mission effectiveness benefits stream&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        OEj = Operational effectiveness benefits stream&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        DCk = Direct development costs stream&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        DIl = Integration costs stream â€¢&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ms = total costs of ownership stream&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        rME, rOE, rDC, rDI and rM all are discount rates accounting for the time value of money. They could all be the&#xD;
        same, or they could all be different.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Again, note that IV, MEi, OEj, DCk, DIl, and Ms all are random variables. Note also that the summation indices are&#xD;
    different, due to the fact that, in general, benefits and costs might accrue at different intervals. In practice, we&#xD;
    usually make these intervals all the same.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A valuable property of NPV as an investment value metric is that it is continuous. It answers two key questions&#xD;
    supporting value-based decision making:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are we creating value? (Is the program healthy? Should we intervene for some reason? Cut our losses?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is this program worth continuing? (Is the program still needed and worth investing in? Should its content be&#xD;
        adjusted?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to think about performing this calculation is in the context of a spreadsheet or matrix. One arranges the&#xD;
    kinds of benefits and costs in the rows. One might place all considered mission effectiveness or revenue benefits in&#xD;
    the first few rows, then operational effectiveness benefits in the next few rows, then direct costs, and so on. Next, a&#xD;
    set of columns is prepared, a set of three columns for each period from the current date out to the projected time&#xD;
    horizon. For example, one might have a time horizon of five years, and the periods might be quarterly. Thus, the number&#xD;
    of columns necessary would be the cost/benefit title, then 3 columns for each of 20 periods. Why 3 columns? This is the&#xD;
    simplest method of satisfying the requirement that each element of each stream be a distribution, rather than a single&#xD;
    number. Three monetary values is a convenient method of describing a triangular distribution (lowest possible, highest&#xD;
    possible, expected value), and triangular distributions have been found particularly applicable to this kind of value&#xD;
    estimation analysis. A triangular distribution isn't the only way to characterize these future values, but it is what&#xD;
    we recommend until the reader has experience with the method as a whole. It is also interesting to see the emotional&#xD;
    difference associated with requesting triangular distributions for estimates, instead of single numbers, from&#xD;
    stakeholders. The stakeholder asked for a single number (how much is it going to cost, for example) will inevitably&#xD;
    game the questioner. A discussion surrounding distributions is generally far more honest, because the stakeholder&#xD;
    quickly realizes that s/he will have an opportunity to discuss uncertainties and risks with the questioner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The next part of the analysis requires automation for reasonable performance. A Monte Carlo simulation must be run on&#xD;
    every distribution (random variable) in the spreadsheet. (You cannot do arithmetic directly on distributions. Monte&#xD;
    Carlo simulation is the easiest and most well-known method for doing arithmetic on random variables.) 1000 trials is&#xD;
    generally sufficient. 10,000, or 100,000 trials is better. There are a few Microsoft Excel spreadsheet plug-in&#xD;
    applications that will do this, such as Oracle's Crystal Ball. Excel itself has a rand() function, so it is possible to&#xD;
    build the Monte Carlo simulation entirely within Excel, though that isn't recommended. For many of these plug-in&#xD;
    applications, a fourth column, that is 4 instead of 3 columns per period, will be useful so that there is workspace for&#xD;
    the result of each Monte Carlo trial.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    More difficult than developing the Monte Carlo simulation is the analysis necessary to monetize benefits that&#xD;
    traditionally may not be quantified in this way. In fact, right about now you may be asking yourself if this is worth&#xD;
    it! Yet it most assuredly is. The analysis work to monetize mission effectiveness benefits, and/or to make estimates&#xD;
    about future revenues in a rigorous, disciplined manner, is extremely valuable to the portfolio management process, and&#xD;
    necessary if one is to deal effectively and objectively with portfolio management decisions. Monetizing mission&#xD;
    effectiveness benefits is beyond the scope of this guideline, but there are numerous references on the topic. One very&#xD;
    useful suggested reference is &lt;em>How to Measure Anything, Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business&lt;/em>, by&#xD;
