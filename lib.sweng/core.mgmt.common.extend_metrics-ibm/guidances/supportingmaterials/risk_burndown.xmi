    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to&amp;nbsp;meet project commitments,&amp;nbsp;the team must identify, analyze, communicate, and mitigate risk&#xD;
    throughout the project lifecycle. Monitoring the progress of risk reduction in a burndown chart provides several&#xD;
    benefits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Helps drive iteration planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provides an easily understood summary of risk that could impact project success. New and escalating risks are&#xD;
        visible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduces the likelihood of focusing on the wrong issues early in the lifecycle that can result in large surprises at&#xD;
        the end of the project. Encourages ongoing and active mitigation efforts and increased communication.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Useful for explaining the team's confidence in their estimates based on remaining uncertainty. Helps describe the&#xD;
        predictability of the project based on remaining risk.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Helps the team understand the effectiveness of their risk mitigation activities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To calculate remaining risk:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    1. Assign the following values to each identified&amp;nbsp;project risk (still outstanding):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Likelihood of occurrence - defined as a percentage (using a standard scale such as 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimated Cost of Impact - defined in hours or days&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. Calculate a score for each risk:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk Score = Likelihood of occurrence * Estimated Cost of Impact&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    3. Determine Overall Risk&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total Risk Score = the sum of all individual Risk Score values&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good way to monitor&amp;nbsp;risk reduction&amp;nbsp;over time is to use a trend line in a burndown chart. The Total Risk&#xD;
    Score is plotted on the Y axis, and the iterations are on the X axis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    As outstanding risks are tracked, trends are identified to help the team understand the predictability of their project&#xD;
    and overall risk status. If sufficient burndown of risk isn't occurring the team can take appropriate corrective&#xD;
    action.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Expected trend&lt;/strong> - Ideally, risk is decreasing over time through active efforts to drive open risks to&#xD;
    closure as the team learns more about the problem domain. The team is reducing uncertainty in each iteration, focusing&#xD;
    first on risks with the highest likelihood of impact and cost, and is providing better estimates, resulting in a more&#xD;
    predictable project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Flat or rising near the middle of lifecycle&lt;/strong> - This trend indicates that the team isn't actively&#xD;
    working to address risk and there is too much uncertainty in the project. The team should base their iteration planning&#xD;
    around use cases and non-functional requirements with the highest risk scores&amp;nbsp;to drive down the level of&#xD;
    outstanding risk. Ensure that test coverage of these requirements is sufficient. Reassess&amp;nbsp; risk during each&#xD;
    iteration retrospective and as needed during daily meetings to ensure that high risk items are communicated. Provide&#xD;
    coaching in risk mitigation techniques. Use the remaining risk level to determine the level of uncertainty in project&#xD;
    estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Fast incline near the end of the lifecycle&lt;/strong> - This trend can occur when the team did not actively work&#xD;
    to identify risks from the earliest iterations (when the impacts of change are least costly) and is presented with&#xD;
    surprises at the end of the lifecycle.&amp;nbsp; If the team determines that the schedule and cost will be impacted as a&#xD;
    result of required work to mitigate late-breaking, newly identified risks, they should collaborate with stakeholders to&#xD;
    determine if scope should be cut or the release date adjusted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Frequency and reporting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The team should evaluate risk at the end of each iteration during a retrospective meeting. Risk Scores are adjusted as&#xD;
    needed, and risks that have been addressed are closed so that the team can update the burndown chart. Trends are&#xD;
    monitored and analyzed to help prioritize activities in the next iteration planning session. Stakeholders are routinely&#xD;
    apprised of current risks and collaborate with the team for impact assessment and mitigation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Collection and reporting tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risks can be captured in IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Team Concert&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Project Conductor&amp;reg;, IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; ReqPro&amp;reg; using&#xD;
    custom attributes, or in a simple spreadsheet. Generate the burndown report by using charting capabilities in a basic&#xD;
    spreadsheet tool.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Assumptions and prerequisites&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time-boxed iterations are scheduled, and iteration length is consistent&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risks are captured, and the team collaborates with stakeholders to determine likelihood and impact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If risk is not managed consistently throughout the lifecycle, the team will likely begin to act in a reactive,&#xD;
        crisis mode as risks emerge. A consistent, repeatable risk mitigation process enables better project predictability&#xD;
        and higher levels of trust by project stakeholders.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The need to identify and monitor risk increases with the complexity of the system.The effort to reduce uncertainty&#xD;
        has an associated cost. The team must balance the cost of this effort against the potential impact of not&#xD;
        addressing the risk. Not all candidate risks are actively managed. Mitigation effort and degree of monitoring&#xD;
        depend on the likelihood of impact and the risk tolerance for the project.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
