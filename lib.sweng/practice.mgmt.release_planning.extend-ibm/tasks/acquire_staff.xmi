    The Project Manager will have determined the staffing needs for the iteration in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.release_planning.extend-ibm/tasks/define_project_organization_and_staffing_490679CB.html&quot; guid=&quot;{8158A0C5-E4B3-4B9F-9DD6-0A32EB233B87}&quot;>Task: Define Project Organization and Staffing&lt;/a>, and will look to the&#xD;
    Human Resources function of the organization to provide staff with the needed domain, skills and experience profiles.&#xD;
    Most organizations do not have the luxury of keeping a large pool of staff on stand-by for projects, and project starts&#xD;
    do not always neatly synchronize with the termination of previous projects. Frequently then, except for a few staff&#xD;
    engaged on the project from the outset, many will need to be hired. This may be a lengthy process, so the prudent&#xD;
    Project Manager will always be looking ahead, and initiating the acquisition of staff for future iterations as well as&#xD;
    the current one. It may be possible to cover shortfalls by working overtime or by the use of contract rather than&#xD;
    permanent staff. Both these solutions have disadvantages, and any systematic and persistent shortfall in staff levels&#xD;
    is a serious risk to schedule.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A role defines the behavior and responsibilities of an individual, or a set of individuals working together, in the&#xD;
    business. The behavior of each role is defined as a set of tasks. The responsibilities of each role are usually defined&#xD;
    relative to certain work products, such as documents, for example. Examples of roles are designer, software architect,&#xD;
    and reviewer. Through the associated set of tasks, the role also implicitly defines a &lt;b>competence&lt;/b>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that roles are not individuals; instead, they describe how individuals should behave in the business, and what&#xD;
    responsibilities these individuals have.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project typically has at its disposal a number of &lt;b>resources&lt;/b>, individuals which have specific competencies.&#xD;
    For example, Joe, Marie, Paul, Sylvia are individuals with different, although overlapping competencies. Using the&#xD;
    roles defined in the delivery process, map resources available to the project onto roles they can play.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;230&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram shows overlapping roles for Paul, Mary, Joe, Sylvia, and Stephan.&quot;     src=&quot;resources/wk_assgn.gif&quot; width=&quot;471&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The association of individual to role is dynamic over time, driven by the phase in the project lifecycle and the work&#xD;
    to be performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An individual might act as several different roles in the same day: For example, Sylvia might be a Reviewer in the&#xD;
        morning, and a Use-Case Designer in the afternoon.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An individual might act as several roles simultaneously: For example, Jane could be both the Software Architect and&#xD;
        the Designer of a certain class, and also the Package Owner of the package that contains this class.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Several people can act as the same role to perform a certain task together, acting as a team: For example, Paul and&#xD;
        Mary could be both Use-Case Designers of the same use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to allocate responsibilities so that there is as little hand-off of work products from one resource to another:&#xD;
    have the same person or team design and implement a subsystem, so that they do not have to re-learn work already done&#xD;
    by others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the same team designs as well as implements, there is a smooth transition from design to implementation. In&#xD;
    addition, it makes for better designers: by learning what works and what does not, they gain a better sense of good&#xD;
    design and incorporate it into future work. Like a sculptor, the good designer must understand the medium of&#xD;
    expression, which for software is the implementation environment.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The shape of the project organization and the required staffing levels for the iteration have been decided by the&#xD;
    Project Manager in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.release_planning.extend-ibm/tasks/define_project_organization_and_staffing_490679CB.html&quot; guid=&quot;{8158A0C5-E4B3-4B9F-9DD6-0A32EB233B87}&quot;>Task: Define Project Organization and Staffing&lt;/a>. With the knowledge&#xD;
    of actual resource availability, it remains to fine-tune this structure and assign staff to it. The Project Manager&#xD;
    should reexamine any team of more than seven staff to see if there is some architecturally sensible way in which it may&#xD;
    be split, say along subsystem lines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Teams should consist of a minimum of two people and a maximum of about seven; teams with more than seven people usually&#xD;
    naturally split themselves into sub-teams, so it's best to do it for them to make life simpler.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In assigning staff to teams, the Project Manager should be sensitive to the overall experience and familiarity level of&#xD;
    the team, and try to create teams with a mix of 'new blood' and staff who have been with the project for some time. At&#xD;
    the beginning of a project, the Project Manager will have to rely on blending experienced staff with more junior staff.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many cases, an inventory of the competencies of the resources available to the project will reveal gaps in the&#xD;
    assignment of team members to roles (assuming that the normal course of trying to recruit additional team members or&#xD;
    hire external contractors has already been tried). In this case, skills will need to be developed. Appropriate training&#xD;
    and mentoring must be obtained for these people, in advance of but in close proximity to the time when they will need&#xD;
    the skills. Training not put to practice immediately rapidly decays. Often, the combination of formal training followed&#xD;
    by a mentor-led workshop to 'jump-start' a task is particularly effective at putting the new skills to work.&#xD;
