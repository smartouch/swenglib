    &lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;>&lt;/a>Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This guideline describes a technique that can be used to estimate software development effort. The Wideband Delphi&#xD;
    estimation method can be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select a team of experts, and provide each with a description of the problem to be estimated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ask each expert to provide an estimate (often anonymously) of the effort, including a breakdown of the problem into&#xD;
        a list of tasks, and an effort estimate for each task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The experts then collaborate, revising their estimates iteratively, until a consensus has been reached.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the Wideband Delphi method provides several advantages over obtaining an estimate from a single individual.&#xD;
    First, it helps build a complete task list or work breakdown structure for major tasks, because each participant will&#xD;
    think of tasks. The consensus approach helps eliminate bias in estimates produced by self-proclaimed experts,&#xD;
    inexperienced estimators or influential individuals who have hidden agendas or divergent objectives. People are&#xD;
    generally more committed to estimates they help produce than to those generated by others. No participant in an&#xD;
    estimation task knows the &quot;right&quot; answer, and creating multiple estimates acknowledges this uncertainty. Finally, users&#xD;
    of the Delphi approach recognize the value of iteration on any complex task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Applying Wideband Delphi&quot; name=&quot;Applying Wideband Delphi&quot;>&lt;/a>Applying Wideband Delphi&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Wideband Delphi can be used to estimate virtually anything-the number of labor months needed to implement a specific&#xD;
    subsystem, the lines of code or number of classes in an entire product, or the gallons of paint needed to redecorate&#xD;
    Bill Gates' house, or the effort it would take a particular organization to achieve level two of the Capability&#xD;
    Maturity Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Delphi method helps you develop a detailed work breakdown structure, which provides the foundation for bottom-up&#xD;
    effort and schedule or size estimation. The starting point for a Delphi session could be a Vision document, a more&#xD;
    detailed Requirements specification of the problem being estimated or an initial high-level architecture description,&#xD;
    or a project schedule. The outputs are a more detailed project task list; a list of associated quality, process-related&#xD;
    and overhead tasks; estimation assumptions; and a set of tasks and overall project estimates, one from each&#xD;
    participant.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 1 illustrates the process flow for a Wideband Delphi session. The problem being estimated is defined and the&#xD;
    participants selected during planning. The kickoff meeting gets all estimators focused on the problem. Each participant&#xD;
    then individually prepares his or her initial task lists and estimates. They bring these items to the estimation&#xD;
    meeting, during which several estimating cycles lead to a more comprehensive task list and a revised set of estimates.&#xD;
    The moderator or project manager then consolidates the assorted estimation information offline, and the team reviews&#xD;
    the estimation results. When some predetermined exit criteria are satisfied, the session is completed. The resulting&#xD;
    range of estimates is likely to be a more realistic predictor of the future than any single estimate. Let's look at&#xD;
    each of these process steps in turn.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram showing wideband Delphi process flow.&quot; src=&quot;resources/wbimg2.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;i>When planning a Wideband Delphi session, the problem is defined and the participants selected. The kickoff meeting&#xD;
    gets all estimators focused on the problem. Each participant then individually prepares initial task lists and&#xD;
    estimates. During the estimation meeting, several cycles lead to a more comprehensive task list and a revised set of&#xD;
    estimates. The information is then consolidated offline, and the team reviews the estimation results. When the exit&#xD;
    criteria are satisfied, the session is completed.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Planning&quot; name=&quot;Planning&quot;>&lt;/a>Planning&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Wideband Delphi session begins with defining and scoping the problem: vision, use case model, existing system,&#xD;
    preliminary architecture. Large problems are broken down into manageable portions that can be estimated more&#xD;
    accurately, perhaps by different teams. The person who initiated the estimation task assembles a problem specification&#xD;
    that will give the participants enough information to produce credible, informed estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The estimation participants include a moderator, who plans and coordinates the task, the project manager and two to&#xD;
    four other estimators. The moderator should be informed enough to participate as an estimator but acts as an impartial&#xD;
    facilitator who won't skew the results with his or her own biases or insights. The participants are selected because&#xD;
    they understand the problem or project and associated estimation issues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Kickoff&quot; name=&quot;The Kickoff&quot;>&lt;/a>The Kickoff&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An initial kickoff meeting of up to an hour gets all participants up to speed on the estimation problem. The moderator&#xD;
    explains Wideband Delphi to team members who are unfamiliar with it and supplies the other estimators with the problem&#xD;
    specification and any assumptions or project constraints. The moderator strives to give the estimators enough&#xD;
    information to do a good job without unduly influencing their estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team reviews the estimation objectives and discusses the problem and any estimation issues. The participants agree&#xD;
    on the estimation units they will use, such as weeks, labor hours, dollars or lines of code. If the moderator concludes&#xD;
    that all team members are sufficiently knowledgeable to contribute to the estimation task, the group is ready to roll.&#xD;
    Otherwise, the participants may need to be briefed more fully on the problem they're estimating, or possibly replaced&#xD;
    by others who can generate more accurate estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To determine whether you're ready to proceed with the Wideband Delphi session, check your entry criteria-that is, the&#xD;
    prerequisites that must be satisfied for you to proceed with subsequent process steps. Before you dive into the&#xD;
    estimation exercise, ensure that the following conditions are satisfied:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Appropriate team members have been selected.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The kickoff meeting has been held.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The participants have agreed on the estimation goal and units.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The project manager can participate in the session.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The estimators have the information they need to participate effectively.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Individual Preparation&quot; name=&quot;Individual Preparation&quot;>&lt;/a>Individual Preparation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Let's assume that you wish to estimate the total amount of work effort (typically expressed in labor hours) needed to&#xD;
    complete a certain project. The estimation process begins with each participant independently developing an initial&#xD;
    list of the tasks that will have to be completed to reach the stated project goal, using a form like that shown in&#xD;
    Figure 2. Each participant then estimates the effort each task will consume. Break each task down into tasks that are&#xD;
    small enough to estimate accurately. State the tasks clearly, because someone will have to merge all of the participant&#xD;
    task lists into a single composite list. Total the estimates you produce for each project task, in the agreed-upon&#xD;
    units, to generate your initial overall estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Chart showing sample Delphi estimation form&quot; src=&quot;resources/wbimg4.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;i>The estimation process begins with each participant independently using this form to develop an initial list of the&#xD;
    tasks that will have to be completed to reach the stated project goal.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Your estimate should have no relationship to the answer you think the project manager or other stakeholders want to&#xD;
    hear. There's a good chance the estimate will fall outside the acceptable project bounds of schedule, effort or cost, a&#xD;
    situation that demands negotiation and might lead to scope reduction, schedule extension or resource adjustments. But&#xD;
    don't let outside pressure sway your best projection of how the project will play out.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to identifying the project tasks, separately record any tasks for related or supporting tasks. Do not&#xD;
    forgot to list tasks dealing with management, configuration management and process-related tasks on the first cycle. Be&#xD;
    sure to include rework tasks following testing or inspection tasks. Reworking to correct defects is a fact of life, so&#xD;
    you should plan for it. If you're estimating a schedule, also think of any overhead tasks that aren't specific to the&#xD;
    project that you might have to build into your planning. These include meetings, vacation, training, other project&#xD;
    assignments and myriad other things that suck time out of your day.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since radically different assumptions can lead to wide estimate variations, record any assumptions you made while&#xD;
    preparing your estimates. For example, if you assumed that you will purchase a specific component library or reuse one&#xD;
    from a previous project, write that down. Another estimator might assume that the project will develop that library,&#xD;
    which will lead to a mismatch between your two overall estimates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep the following estimation guidelines in mind:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assume one person (you) will perform all tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assume all tasks will be performed sequentially; don't worry about sequencing and predecessor tasks at this time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assume that you can devote uninterrupted effort to each task (this may seem absurdly optimistic, but it simplifies&#xD;
        the estimation process).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In units of calendar time, list any known waiting times you expect to encounter between tasks. This will help you&#xD;
        translate effort estimates into schedule estimates later on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Estimation Meeting&quot; name=&quot;Estimation Meeting&quot;>&lt;/a>Estimation Meeting&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The moderator begins the estimation meeting by collecting the participants' individual estimates and creating a chart&#xD;
    such as Figure 3. Each participant's total project estimate is shown as an X on the &quot;Round 1&quot; line. Each estimator can&#xD;
    see where his or her initial value fits along the spectrum. The initial estimates probably will cover a frighteningly&#xD;
    large range. Just imagine the different conclusions you might have collected had you asked just one of the participants&#xD;
    for his or her estimate and used that to plan the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Chart showing initial estimation from a Wideband Delphi session.&quot; src=&quot;resources/wbimg6.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;i>The moderator begins the estimation meeting by collecting and charting the participants' individual estimates. Each&#xD;
    participant's total project estimate is shown as an X on the &quot;Round 1&quot; line. The initial estimates probably will cover&#xD;
    a frighteningly large range.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some organization, the moderator does not identify who created each estimate; they feel this anonymity is an&#xD;
    important aspect of the Delphi technique. Anonymity prevents an outspoken colleague from intimidating the other&#xD;
    participants into seeing things his or her way. It also means team members are less likely to defer to the most&#xD;
    respected participant's judgment when their own analyses lead to different conclusions. But this is not a must.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each estimator reads his initial task list, identifying any assumptions made and raising any questions or issues,&#xD;
    without revealing which estimate was his. Each participant will have listed different tasks that need to be performed.&#xD;
    Combining these individual task lists leads to a more complete list than any single estimator is likely to produce.&#xD;
    This approach will work for up to several dozen individual tasks. If you have more tasks than that, they might be too&#xD;
    detailed. You may want to break the problem into several subproblems and estimate them individually.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this initial discussion, the team members also talk about their assumptions, estimation issues and questions&#xD;
    they have about the problem. As a result, the team will begin to converge on a shared set of assumptions and a common&#xD;
    task list. Retain this final task list to use as a starting point the next time you must estimate a similar project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After this initial discussion, all participants modify their estimates concurrently (and silently) in the meeting room.&#xD;
    They might revise their task lists based on the information shared during the discussion, and they'll adjust individual&#xD;
    task estimates based on their new understanding of the task scope or changed assumptions. All estimators can add new&#xD;
    tasks to their forms and note any changes they wish to make to their initial task estimates. The net change for all&#xD;
    tasks equals the change in that participant's overall project estimate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The moderator collects the revised overall estimates and plots them on the same chart, on the &quot;Round 2&quot; line. I've done&#xD;
    this on a whiteboard for easy visibility. As Figure 4 illustrates, the second round might lead to a narrower&#xD;
    distribution of estimates centered around a higher mean than the mean of the Round 1 values. Additional rounds should&#xD;
    further narrow the distribution. The cycle of revising the task list, discussing issues and assumptions and preparing&#xD;
    new estimates continues until the following conditions are met:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        you have completed four rounds&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the estimates have converged to an acceptably narrow range (defined in advance)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the allotted meeting time was met (typically two hours)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        all participants are unwilling to alter their latest estimates&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Estimation chart showing three rounds from a Wideband Delphi session.&quot; src=&quot;resources/wbimg8.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;i>After discussion of the initial estimates, all participants modify their estimates. The moderator collects the&#xD;
    revised overall estimates and plots them on the same chart, on the &quot;Round 2&quot; line. These later rounds might lead to a&#xD;
    narrower distribution of estimates centered around a higher mean than the mean of the Round 1 values.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The moderator keeps the group on track, time-boxing discussions to 15 or 20 minutes to avoid endless rambling. The&#xD;
    moderator should follow effective meeting facilitation practices, such as starting and ending on time, encouraging all&#xD;
    participants to contribute and maintaining an impartial and non-judgmental environment. While preserving the anonymity&#xD;
    of individual estimates is important for the first couple of rounds, the team members might agree at some point to put&#xD;
    all their cards on the table and reach closure through an open discussion. This gives them a chance to discuss tasks&#xD;
    for which their estimates vary substantially. Otherwise, though, the moderator should not identify the individual who&#xD;
    produced each final estimate until the session is completed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Assembling Tasks&quot; name=&quot;Assembling Tasks&quot;>&lt;/a>Assembling Tasks&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work isn't done when the estimation meeting concludes. Either the moderator or the project manager assembles the&#xD;
    project tasks and their individual estimates into a single master task list. This person also merges the individual&#xD;
    lists of assumptions, quality- and process-related tasks, overhead tasks and wait times.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The merging process involves removing duplicate tasks and reaching some reasonable resolution of different estimates&#xD;
    for individual tasks. &quot;Reasonable&quot; doesn't mean replacing the team's estimates with values the project manager prefers.&#xD;
    Large estimate differences for apparently similar tasks might indicate that estimators interpreted that task in&#xD;
    different ways. For example, two people might both have an task called &quot;implement a class.&quot; However, one estimator&#xD;
    might have included unit testing and code review in the task, while the other meant just the coding effort. All&#xD;
    estimators should define their tasks clearly to minimize confusion during this merging step. The merging step should&#xD;
    retain the estimate range for each task, but if one estimator's task estimate was wildly different from that of the&#xD;
    other estimators, understand it and then perhaps discard or modify it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Review Results&quot; name=&quot;Review Results&quot;>&lt;/a>Review Results&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the final step, the estimation team reviews the summarized results and reaches agreement on the final outcome. The&#xD;
    project manager provides the other estimators with the overall task list, individual estimates, cumulative estimates,&#xD;
    assumption list and any other information. Bring the team back together for a 30- to 60-minute review meeting to bring&#xD;
    closure to the estimation task. This meeting also provides an opportunity for the team to contemplate this execution of&#xD;
    the Wideband Delphi process and suggest ways it can be improved for future applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The participants should make sure the final task list is as complete as possible. They might have thought of additional&#xD;
    tasks since the estimation meeting, which could be added to the task list now. Check to see whether tasks that had&#xD;
    wildly different individual estimates have been merged in a sensible way. The ultimate objective is to produce an&#xD;
    estimate range that allows the project manager and other key stakeholders to proceed with project planning and&#xD;
    execution at an acceptable confidence level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Completing the Estimation&quot; name=&quot;Completing the Estimation&quot;>&lt;/a>Completing the Estimation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The estimation process is completed when specified exit criteria are satisfied, at which point you can declare victory&#xD;
    and move on with your life. Typical Wideband Delphi exit criteria are that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>The overall task list has been assembled. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You have a summarized list of estimating assumptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The estimators have reached consensus on how their individual estimates were synthesized into a single set with an&#xD;
    acceptable range.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now you must decide what to do with the data. You could simply average the final estimates to come up with a single&#xD;
    point estimate, which is what the person who requested the estimate probably wants to hear. However, a simple average&#xD;
    is likely to be too low, and there's merit in retaining the estimate range. Estimates are predictions of the future,&#xD;
    and the range reflects the inherent uncertainty of gazing into the crystal ball. You might present three numbers: the&#xD;
    average of the estimates as the planned case, the minimum value as the best case and the maximum as the worst case. Or&#xD;
    you could present the average value as the nominal expected outcome, plus the maximum-minus-the-average value, and&#xD;
    minus the average-minus-the-minimum value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each estimate has a certain probability of coming true, so a set of estimates forms a probability distribution. In&#xD;
    Chapter 6 of A Discipline for Software Engineering (Addison-Wesley, 1995), Watts Humphrey describes a mathematically&#xD;
    precise way to combine multiple estimates and their uncertainties to generate an overall estimate with upper and lower&#xD;
    prediction intervals. Another sophisticated approach is to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a probability&#xD;
    distribution of possible estimate outcomes based on the final estimate values.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While the results of a Delphi session might not be what the movers and shakers want to hear, they can decide whether&#xD;
    they want to plan their project at a 10 percent confidence level, a 90 percent confidence level or somewhere&#xD;
    in-between. Be sure to compare the actual project results to your estimates to improve your future estimating accuracy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Doing It Again&quot; name=&quot;Doing It Again&quot;>&lt;/a>Doing It Again (Iterating)&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One nice aspect of this method is that after an initial and rather rough estimate done for example during inception,&#xD;
    the estimates can be refined at each phase (or even at each iteration). The process can be faster if the same&#xD;
    estimators are available, starting where they left at the previous estimation cycle. More information about the problem&#xD;
    is available, some assumptions have been modified, an architecture is in place to help break down the effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The new estimate may have a narrower range, but is not necessarily within the range of the previous one: it may be&#xD;
    higher, or smaller. If higher, there is a clear risk signal to the project manager, risk that must be tackled at once.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Wideband Delphi Evaluated&quot; name=&quot;Wideband Delphi Evaluated&quot;>&lt;/a>Wideband Delphi Evaluated&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    No estimation method is perfect; if it were, it would be called prediction, not estimation. However, the Wideband&#xD;
    Delphi technique incorporates some solid estimating principles. The team approach acknowledges the value of combining&#xD;
    multiple expert perspectives. The range of estimates produced reflects the variability intrinsic to the estimation&#xD;
    process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although it takes time and requires a panel of experienced estimators, Wideband Delphi removes some of the politics&#xD;
    from estimation and filters out extreme initial values.&#xD;
