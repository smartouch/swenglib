    &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;>Figure 1&amp;nbsp;illustrates a services architecture involving three participants (dealer, mfg, and&#xD;
    shipper) and three services (Purchasing Service, Ship Status, and Ship).&amp;nbsp;Each service is modeled using a&#xD;
    CollaborationUse that is typed as the ServiceContract which is associated with the service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;>&lt;strong>Figure 1.&amp;nbsp; A ServicesArchitecture involving three participants and three services.&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    Note: the purpose of the dealer network architecture is to establish the financially related services between dealers&#xD;
    and manufacturers such that any dealer can do business with any manufacturer.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/services_architecture_example_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;>This services architecture shows how a community of dealers, manufacturers, and shippers can work&#xD;
    together. Each party must provide and use the services specified in the architecture. If they do, they will then be&#xD;
    able to participate in this community. This &quot;B2B&quot; SOA specifies the roles of the parties and the services they provide&#xD;
    and use without specifying anything about who they are, their organizational structure, or internal processes. No&#xD;
    &quot;controller&quot; or &quot;mediator&quot; is required as long as each agrees to the service contracts.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;>By specifying a ServicesArchitecture, we can understand the services in our enterprise and communities&#xD;
    in context and recognize the real (business) dependencies that exist between the participants. The purpose of the&#xD;
    services architecture might also be specified as a comment. Each participant in a ServicesArchitecture must have a port&#xD;
    that is compatible with the roles played in each ServiceContract role it is bound to.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 2&amp;nbsp;serves to illustrate how the different elements in a ServicesArchitecture are related (the red&amp;nbsp;lines&#xD;
    are illustrative only and have no UML meaning).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;>The diagram shows the &quot;trace&quot; between a service architecture through the participants and their service&#xD;
    points to the service contract that defines the service interfaces for each of the service points. What the above shows&#xD;
    is that the Dealer&amp;nbsp;and Manufacturer are participants in a &quot;Dealer Network Architecture&quot; in which the dealer plays&#xD;
    the role of the &quot;buyer&quot; in the &quot;Purchasing Service&quot; and the &quot;Manufacturer&quot; plays the role of the seller in the same&#xD;
    service. Participating in these services requires that they have service ports defined on the participant type - these&#xD;
    are the ports on &quot;Dealer&quot; and &quot;Manufacturer&quot; types. These ports have a ServiceInterface type defined in the &quot;Purchasing&#xD;
    Service&quot; contract. These service interfaces each have two ports because Purchasing Service is a compound service&#xD;
    contract - the service interfaces have a port for each nested service: Ordering Service &amp;amp; Invoicing Service,&#xD;
    respectively.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    service contract and compound service contracts.&lt;/font>&#xD;
