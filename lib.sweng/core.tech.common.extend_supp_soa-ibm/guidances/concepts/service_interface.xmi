    &lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>&lt;strong>The Service Interface&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Service interfaces are key specification elements within service design.&amp;nbsp; A service interface must specify&#xD;
    everything that a potential consumer of the service needs to know to decide if they are interested in using the&#xD;
    service, as well as exactly how to use it. It must also specify everything a service provider must know to successfully&#xD;
    implement the service. At the heart of SOA is the construction of service value chains that connect consumer needs with&#xD;
    compatible provider capabilities. Service interfaces define the goals, needs and expectations of consuming participants&#xD;
    as well as the value propositions, capabilities and commitments of provider participants. They therefore provide the&#xD;
    information necessary to determine compatible needs and capabilities.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Ideally, this information is provided in a single place. This makes it easy to search asset repositories for reusable&#xD;
    services and to get all of the necessary information without having to navigate many different documents or search for&#xD;
    related elements. Service interfaces include at least this information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The name of the service, suggesting its purpose.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The provided and required interfaces, thereby defining the functional capabilities that are provided by the service&#xD;
        and those that it requires of its consumers Note: This is not about how the service is implemented, but rather the&#xD;
        interaction between the consumers and providers for this service.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any protocol that specifies rules for how the functional capabilities are used or in what order.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Constraints that reflect what successful use of the service is intended to accomplish and how it will be evaluated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Qualities that service consumers&amp;nbsp;expect to receive&amp;nbsp;and that providers are expected to provide, such as&#xD;
        cost, availability, performance, footprint, suitability to the task, competitive information, and so forth.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Policies for using the service, such as security and transaction scopes for maintaining security and integrity or&#xD;
        for recovering from the inability to successfully perform the service or any required service.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
