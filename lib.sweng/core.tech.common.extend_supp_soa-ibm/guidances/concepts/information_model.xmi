    To understand the concept of an information model, we need to take a look at the hierarchy of knowledge:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Data&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A fact in its raw form&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset based&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Always persistent (stored somewhere in some form)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Information&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Has semantic context and meaning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Based on understanding&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can&amp;nbsp;be either persistent on transient (to a degree where potentially it only exists in the mind of someone)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Knowledge&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Information applied in process context&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Always transient&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Classically, IT has mostly had its focus on data, typically with a management perspective.&amp;nbsp;With SOA and the&#xD;
    resulting need to structurally understand relationships between services, processes and information, all in a business&#xD;
    value context, the focus is shifting much more towards knowledge. From a business process perspective, what is produced&#xD;
    and propagated through the process is knowledge - knowledge that has a symbiotic relationship to the underlying&#xD;
    information. All of this means that information in general, and information life cycles in particular, is important to&#xD;
    the SOA practitioner.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In the same way that a data model is built from data entities, an information model is built from information entities,&#xD;
    representing &quot;atomic&quot; pieces of information as well as the relevant relationships and dependencies. What is different&#xD;
    is that where a data entity must have some real shape or form, an information entity&amp;nbsp;might not (yet) exist as&#xD;
    anything but an architectural abstraction. A few examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At the early stages of a project, an information model is developed in order to capture the reporting requirements&#xD;
        of the solution. We do not yet have any idea how to derive the information entities from data, nor for that matter&#xD;
        whether it is even realistic, all we know is that there are the information requirements raised on the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
            An information model is developed to capture the information entities being leveraged in a sales process. Some&#xD;
            of these information entities might later be based on data, others might be provided by people interacting in&#xD;
            the process, never captured as data at all.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What we can deduce from these examples is that the concept of an information model is a logical, architectural concept,&#xD;
    and that not all information entities ever end up being supported by underlying data. In order to provide a business&#xD;
    solution, we typically always are in need of an information model. In order to provide IT enablement of that solution,&#xD;
    we will need a data model corresponding to only that part of the information model that is in fact IT enabled.&#xD;
