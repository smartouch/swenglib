  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service model is an abstraction of the IT services implemented within an enterprise. It supports the development of&#xD;
    one or more service-oriented solutions. It is used to conceive and document the design of the software services. It is&#xD;
    a comprehensive, composite work product encompassing all services, providers, specifications, partitions, messages,&#xD;
    collaborations, and the relationships between them. It is needed for the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identifying candidate services and capture decisions about which services will actually be exposed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specifying the contract between the service provider and the consumer of the services&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Associating Services with the components needed to realize these services&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Service Model captures the details of a set of services. It can be created and maintained across the lifetimes of&#xD;
    one or many projects.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The service model&amp;nbsp;can be used for different levels of scope:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Service-scoped development&lt;/strong> where the scope of the project is to develop the service independently&#xD;
        (as much as possible) from other services. The modeling would therefore encompass the use cases, architecture,&#xD;
        design and implementation models as a vertical slice for the one service.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Project-scoped development&lt;/strong> where a project involves the specification of a number of services to&#xD;
        support&amp;nbsp;a set of application or business process requirements.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the scope is broadened to&#xD;
        the application/business process&amp;nbsp;level.&amp;nbsp; It might involve several services. In effect, there is a set&#xD;
        of&amp;nbsp;models for use cases/business processes&amp;nbsp;and architecture, and then there is a set of service-specific&#xD;
        design and implementation models.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Enterprise-scoped development&lt;/strong>, or service portfolio management, where the scope is only to capture&#xD;
        the service specifications and logical partitioning, but at an enterprise-wide scope. This allows designers and&#xD;
        architects to make wide ranging decisions about the entire portfolio, yet separate projects are required to develop&#xD;
        the design and implementation models for the identified services (and client applications and/or business&#xD;
        processes).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following diagram demonstrates the key aspects of the Service Model, abstractly, and the relationship between them&#xD;
    and the Identification, Specification, and Realization activities that are part of the service solution design&#xD;
    lifecycle:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service model is often a heterogeneous collection of physical assets, including UML models, documents, and possibly&#xD;
    entries in a requirements management tool. However, the service model has to address the items listed in the above&#xD;
    diagram.&#xD;
