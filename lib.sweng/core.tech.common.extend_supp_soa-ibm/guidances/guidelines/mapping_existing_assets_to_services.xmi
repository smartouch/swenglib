  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Mapping custom applications into services&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Existing applications are mapped into services using a two-step approach:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        First, map business processes to the portfolio of existing applications.&amp;nbsp; This is referred to as&#xD;
        &lt;strong>coarse-grained mapping&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Second, map a specific service to a specific function, transaction, or batch process within the legacy&#xD;
        application.&amp;nbsp; This is referred to as &lt;strong>fine-grained mapping&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Fine-grained mapping is context-dependent.&amp;nbsp; For this reason, it will not be discussed within this general&#xD;
    guideline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Coarse-grained mapping&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of coarse-grained mapping is to derive the&amp;nbsp;initial mapping of existing business functions to services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to identify candidate services from functionality in existing applications, the relationship between the&#xD;
    business process and existing applications must be understood. This can be described as coarse-grained mapping. This&#xD;
    mapping is between the business activities or business processes and the business functions of existing applications as&#xD;
    shown below.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 1.&amp;nbsp; Coarse-grained mapping between business processes and existing business functions&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img height=&quot;275&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/technique-fig40.gif&quot; width=&quot;319&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To capture the relationships between business processes and existing applications,&amp;nbsp;perform the following&#xD;
    coarse-grained mapping steps:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the business functions supported by each application.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&#xD;
        Typically a business function can be mapped to an activity within a business process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Record attributes of existing applications in terms of technologies used, architectural styles, etc.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify applications that perform common services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Coarse-grained mapping and application portfolio analysis&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Application portfolio analysis is a necessary adjunct to coarse-grained mapping.&amp;nbsp; Understanding the business value&#xD;
    and the technical quality of existing applications helps in creating a transformational plan with highest priority&#xD;
    given to the highest value services.&amp;nbsp; Application portfolio analysis also helps&amp;nbsp;to assess scope and technical&#xD;
    risks based on the technical qualities of the application, for example, degree of coupling.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 2.&amp;nbsp; Results provided by application portfolio analysis&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;230&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/technique-fig41.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Application portfolio analysis provides scope and boundaries for coarse-grain mapping. For example, applications with&#xD;
    minimal business value or low technical value which are targeted for obsolescence would probably not be in scope for&#xD;
    candidate service identification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Application portfolio analysis, if performed,&amp;nbsp;can provide information about existing services for coarse-grained&#xD;
    mapping. The output of this combined analysis is candidate services as shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 3.&amp;nbsp; Application portfolio analysis + coarse grained mapping yield candidate services&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img height=&quot;214&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/technique-fig42.gif&quot; width=&quot;537&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Mapping ISV packages into services&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Independent Software Vendor (ISV) packages are commonly implemented to enable subsystems and/or service components&#xD;
    within an organization. For example, comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) ISV packages, such as those&#xD;
    offered by SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle, are often implemented as complete systems comprising multiple subsystems that&#xD;
    fully support one or more Domains within an organization. This section describes a series of steps that will enable the&#xD;
    practitioner to identify functionality and candidate services within existing ISV packages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Note&lt;/b>: Because each ISV package is different, it is not possible to develop a detailed prescriptive approach for&#xD;
    each one. The following activities describe a generic approach and a generic set of activities that will:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify candidate services within ISV packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the high-level characteristics of the ISV packages that will be considered during service realization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    ISV Package Identification&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some ISV packages, such as SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle,&amp;nbsp;comprise a number of core and optional modules. For&#xD;
    example, SAP has a manufacturing module, human resources module, and customer relationship management module. In these&#xD;
    cases, it is important to specify which specific modules of the ISV packages are being used. This will result in a more&#xD;
    focused analysis that will save time and avoid unnecessary services proliferation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    ISV Package Categorization&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Categorization of ISV Packages provides high-level insight into important characteristics that will need to be&#xD;
    considered during service realization (this applies to both functional and technical components). ISVs can be&#xD;
    categorized as Tier 1, 2 or 3 ISVs based on characteristics such as their core competencies, size and revenue as&#xD;
    summarized in Table 1. Note in particular the Technical Impact and Business Impact aspects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;strong>Table 1.&amp;nbsp; Characteristics to apply to categorize packaged application vendors&lt;br />&#xD;

            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Large ISVs like the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendors providing packaged applications that help&#xD;
                businesses manage their core resources and operations.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Medium to smaller ISVs that tend to offer industry specific vertical business solutions&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;ul>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Integrated, multi-module, cross-industry applications for product planning, parts purchasing,&#xD;
                        maintaining inventories, interacting with suppliers, providing customer service, and tracking&#xD;
                        orders.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Can also include application modules for the finance and human resources aspects of a business.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Typically span multiple functional areas and even domains&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Are often packaged with their own proprietary middleware, security and other technical components&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;/ul>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;ul>&#xD;
                    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
                        Typically enable industry-specific vertical subsystems that support a specific function within an&#xD;
                        enterprise.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Typically have documented business interfaces with one or more Tier 1 ISVs.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Usually contained within a business and a small number of functional areas.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Usually rely on external, third party middleware and other technical components.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                    &lt;li>&#xD;
                        Might have their own security components.&#xD;
                    &lt;/li>&#xD;
                &lt;/ul>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Technical Impact&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Given their large &quot;footprint&quot;, these ISVs might have a significant influence on the technical architecture&#xD;
                and standards used within an organization. In these cases, these influences are identified and considered&#xD;
                during service realization.&lt;br />&#xD;
                The middleware and other technical components, such as authentication and logging, will need to be&#xD;
                considered during service realization.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                These ISVs typically have less architectural influence within a large organization, but in a smaller,&#xD;
                highly specialized industry-specific organization, they too might have a significant influence on service&#xD;
                realization.&lt;br />&#xD;
                These packages typically do not provide their own middleware or technical components. They might rely on&#xD;
                third-party middleware and technical components - or might rely on those provided by a Tier 1 ISV. Some&#xD;
                smaller ISVs might not provide interfaces to technical components.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;b>Business Impact&lt;/b>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Organizations that have invested in Tier 1 ISVs frequently have a predisposition to leverage these ISV&#xD;
                packages to the fullest extent possible. In these cases, there will be a strong propensity to use these&#xD;
                existing packages to realize services and also to enable new services.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Because these packages tend to enable a narrower scope of functionality, there is less propensity and&#xD;
                opportunity to extend these packages to realize new services.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;b>Examples&lt;/b>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                SAP, Siebel, Peoplesoft, Oracle Financials&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                Manugistics, Provia, Evoke/TD&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because&amp;nbsp;ISV packages are used within virtually every organization, most service-oriented solutions will&#xD;
    incorporate services realized through Service Components based on ISV packages. Categorizing these ISV packages will&#xD;
    enable the practitioner to understand the role and relative importance of these packages within the SOA solution, and&#xD;
    also identify technical and functional characteristics that will be considered during service realization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each ISV package, an understanding in the following areas is obtained through the analysis performed during&#xD;
    categorization:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An understanding of the significance and influence of this ISV package within the enterprise.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The propensity to realize any new services through this ISV package.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The architecture standards and technical components used within the ISV package and their role within the&#xD;
        enterprise.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An understanding of the middleware and technical components compatible with the ISV package.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Analyze Options for Service Access within ISV Packages&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step identifies the mechanisms by which functions within the ISV packages can be accessed (that is,&amp;nbsp;technical&#xD;
    aspects of the package directly related to service exposure and realization). This information is used to help identify&#xD;
    candidate services within the ISV packages (in the next step) and will also be used later for assessing technical&#xD;
    feasibility and making service realization decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Several mechanisms&amp;nbsp;can be used to access ISV packages. During this step, each in-scope package is analyzed to&#xD;
    determine and describe which mechanisms are available for each package. In general, ISV packages will support one or&#xD;
    more of the&amp;nbsp;mechanisms described in Table 2:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Table 2.&amp;nbsp; Options for accessing ISV packaged applications&lt;/strong>&#xD;

        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;b>Mechanism&lt;/b>&#xD;

                &lt;b>Direct exposure as a service&lt;/b>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                The package directly exposes functionality using SOA-compatible services, which are typically Web Services.&#xD;
                These services might be listed in a catalog. The specific implementation is assessed for conformance to&#xD;
                standards and interoperability.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;b>Use of APIs&lt;/b>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                The package provides one or more APIs that might be used to expose services within the package. These APIs&#xD;
                might be used directly to expose functionality as a service, or Web Services wrappers or a facade&amp;nbsp;can&#xD;
                be developed to enable access to functionality through the API.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                &lt;b>Direct data access&lt;/b>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;>&#xD;
                In the case where no APIs are available, but a service that exposes data managed by the ISV package is&#xD;
                required, a service that directly accesses the database used by the package is developed.&lt;br />&#xD;
                &lt;i>Note: While this approach might be technically feasible, bypassing business logic within the ISV package&#xD;
                introduces a potential risk of corrupting data or violating program enforced data integrity. For this&#xD;
                reason, it is recommended that this technique be restricted to services that perform &quot;read-only&quot;&#xD;
                operations. Even so, this approach is still at risk due to potential changes to the ISV's data schema. Use&#xD;
                this&amp;nbsp;with great caution.&lt;/i>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    ISV Packages Service Identification Techniques&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this step, several techniques are used to analyze the ISV packages and identify functionality that can&#xD;
    potentially be exposed as a service. Business rules associated with the functionality are also identified. Each&#xD;
    technique is used to assess packages from a different perspective, enabling the packages to be thoroughly analyzed for&#xD;
    candidate services. Analysis results can be captured in a matrix that relates business function vs. existing system,&#xD;
    and in a business rules catalog.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the ISV packages' catalog of pre-defined services&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        Some ISV packages offer a catalog of pre-defined services. If so, candidate services for the in-scope business&#xD;
        domains and functional areas are identified through the catalog and added to the Candidate Service Portfolio. If&#xD;
        supported by the ISV, this technique represents the easiest way to identify candidate services using the ISV&#xD;
        packages.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;b>Note&lt;/b>: During service specification, the degree of granularity of these services will be considered as part&#xD;
        of making service exposure decisions. Hence, it is important to capture the degree of granularity as a&#xD;
        characteristic of candidate services during service identification. It might be necessary to aggregate or decompose&#xD;
        exposed services, depending upon the degree to which they align with the services realized within the ISV packages.&#xD;
        This analysis also helps align candidate services within the service hierarchy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
            Review the ISV packages' APIs&lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;br />&#xD;
            ISV packages might offer one or more APIs that can be used to access functionality within the packages. Examine&#xD;
            these APIs&amp;nbsp;for the in-scope domains and functional areas to identify candidate services to be added to the&#xD;
            candidate service portfolio.&amp;nbsp;Because functionality accessible through these APIs will not natively be&#xD;
            offered as a service, a service wrapper or façade will need to be developed to expose these API calls as&#xD;
            services. The flexibility of this approach enables the combination of two or more API calls within a single&#xD;
            service.&amp;nbsp; This might enable services within the packages to be developed to align with services in the&#xD;
            service hierarchy. In this case, the practitioner identifies services within the service hierarchy and maps&#xD;
            these to the supporting functionality and API calls within the packages.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review ISV business process maps and workflow&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        The business processes and workflow enabled by an ISV packages might be documented in either a hard copy or&#xD;
        in&amp;nbsp;electronic format. These artifacts are examined to identify additional candidate services for addition to&#xD;
        the service portfolio. Specifically, this review&amp;nbsp;needs to&amp;nbsp;take an end-to-end view of business processes&#xD;
        within the packages, as well as the workflow context in which the process is executed. This enables any related&#xD;
        candidate services to be identified.&amp;nbsp; It also identifies business process and workflow considerations that&#xD;
        need to be considered during service realization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify ISV packages' service boundaries&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        An ISV package is developed to support business processes and manage data with a scope that is aligned&#xD;
        with&amp;nbsp;functional areas and domains. These business components form the &quot;footprint&quot; or &quot;service boundary&quot; for&#xD;
        the ISV packages. However, within a specific enterprise, the ISV package might be implemented within a subset of&#xD;
        the overall service boundary for that package. By identifying the overall service boundary for the ISV package, the&#xD;
        practitioner determines if additional services within the package's service boundary&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be added to&#xD;
        the candidate service portfolio. More importantly, the practitioner can determine if new services that are&#xD;
        required&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be realized through the ISV packages&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        If it is determined that new services are required to enable the service-oriented solution, the&#xD;
        practitioner&amp;nbsp;needs to determine if these services fall within the service boundary for the ISV package. If&#xD;
        they do, services within the ISV package that support the required functionality are identified and added to the&#xD;
        candidate service portfolio. This enables the solution to leverage the full capabilities of the ISV package, and it&#xD;
        reduces the risk of developing duplication within multiple systems supporting the same business component.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze data elements controlled within the ISV packages&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        The data elements within the scope of the solution are assessed to determine if they are managed within the ISV&#xD;
        packages. If data is managed within the ISV packages, other business processes within the packages that read or&#xD;
        update the same data are analyzed for candidate services to add to the candidate service portfolio.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        This analysis also reveals related or external processes and interfaces that might be affected by the solution and&#xD;
        that must be considered during service realization. These are documented and assessed during service realization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze ISV security and other technical components&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        Many ISV packages contain their own security components for authentication and authorization and might contain&#xD;
        other technical components that support functions such as logging and messaging. For each package, identify and&#xD;
        analyze these components to identify candidate technical services that&amp;nbsp;can be added to the candidate service&#xD;
        portfolio.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        In addition, during this analysis, any issues or constraints that might be introduced by these components are&#xD;
        identified for consideration during service realization. For example, the interaction required with the package's&#xD;
        security components to access functionality within the package must be understood and accommodated during service&#xD;
        realization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Applying these various analysis techniques will enable candidate services within the in-scope ISV packages to be&#xD;
    identified from several different perspectives. It will also identify issues and constraints introduced by the&#xD;
    functional and technical components of the ISV packages that must be considered during service realization.&#xD;
