  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that the DO-178B standard calls for a number of project plans as deliverables. It is anticipated that the process&#xD;
    content in this configuration forms the base content for most of those plans (see the Artifact section). This entails&#xD;
    customizing this&amp;nbsp;content for each new project with project-specific information. This refers specifically to the&#xD;
    Software Configuration Management Plan, Software Quality Assurance Plan, Software Development Plan, and Software&#xD;
    Verification Plan, supplemented with additional project data in external documents. The Plan for Software Aspects of&#xD;
    Certification is created within the DO-178B Certification Practice but results in an external document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Process assets provided within the library include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tasks - include a description of the task, a set of inputs and outputs, the identification of responsible and&#xD;
        involved roles, and links to variance forms of guidance to aid in the performance of the task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work Products / Artifacts - are the things consumed or produced by tasks and are the tangible results of those&#xD;
        efforts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Roles - specify the responsibilities of jobs within the context of the process. Roles may be assigned to tasks as&#xD;
        primary or optional performers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        General guidance - there are a number of different kinds of guidance, such as checklists, term definitions,&#xD;
        concepts, examples, and work product templates that are provided.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    How to use the DO-178B&amp;nbsp;Mapping&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We anticipate a number of different ways this content&amp;nbsp;can be used. For this reason, we support navigation&#xD;
    from&amp;nbsp;the DO-178B elements to relevant process and practice content in different ways: by Objective, by Software&#xD;
    Certification Level, by Artifact, and by Checklist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    By Objective&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objectives are organized into the same groupings as Appendix A of the DO-178B standard. By clicking on the link, on&#xD;
    the DO-178B Objectives page, a set of links - one per category - is provided. Clicking on those links takes you to a&#xD;
    page of the objectives within that category of Appendix A. Each objective, with an active hyperlink, is described and&#xD;
    the relevant software certification level given. If you click on the specific objective, you will navigate to a page&#xD;
    specific to that objective with a brief description and links to the relevant Rational Practice content.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    By Software Certification Level&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The standard identifies a total of 66 objectives. All of these apply to Level A certification, but not all of them&#xD;
    apply to lower levels. If you have decided the level of certification required, then the links on the relevant page&#xD;
    will point to the standard objectives relevant to that level of certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    By Work Product&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The DO-178B standard calls out a number of work products, such as SCM Records and the Plan for Software Aspects of&#xD;
    Certification (PSAC). This page provides links to the most important of these. The relevant work products are described&#xD;
    and several have standard templates that can be used directly or customized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    By Checklist&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a number of tasks and work products, checklists are provided to ensure completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the&#xD;
    work product against the objectives as stated in the standard. This page provides links to the most important provided&#xD;
    checklists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Note&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;content does not in any way reduce the need to engage a Designated Design Representative (DER) for the&#xD;
    certification of a specific product. The purpose is to aid in the development of the work products and performance of&#xD;
    relevant tasks as specified in the standard. A DER is still required for certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
