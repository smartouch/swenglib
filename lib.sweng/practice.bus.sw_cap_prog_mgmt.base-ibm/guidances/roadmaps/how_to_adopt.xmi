    Getting Started&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Assess the&amp;nbsp;organization&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assess the current state of the organization's software capabilities&amp;nbsp;to better understand what needs improvement.&#xD;
    Recommend improvements that are prioritized and aligned with organization's business and operational objectives. If&#xD;
    your organization places a higher priority on time to delivery than cost, then your process improvement priorities&#xD;
    should reflect that objective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Introduce incremental process and tools improvements&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Plan to implement&amp;nbsp;the process and tools improvements&amp;nbsp;incrementally so&amp;nbsp;teams won't be overwhelmed by many&#xD;
    new factors all at once. By implementing incrementally, it is&amp;nbsp;possible to focus on a subset of the process, which&#xD;
    increases the probability of success.&lt;br />&#xD;

    you&amp;nbsp;decide which process and&amp;nbsp; tools improvements you should start to introduce first. Focus on those areas&#xD;
    where the development organization has its biggest problems. Taking small steps, making a few improvements at a time,&#xD;
    and book successes (quick wins) before starting on the next improvements. In this way, project teams will not become&#xD;
    overwhelmed, and stakeholders can be convinced that you are making progress.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Manage and plan&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Manage and plan the&amp;nbsp;capability improvement&amp;nbsp;activities just as you would all other activities in&amp;nbsp;a&#xD;
    software development project. Implementing new processes and new tools&amp;nbsp;across an organization&amp;nbsp;is a complex&#xD;
    task. Changing the way people work can jeopardize the success of projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use mentors to ensure adoption through execution. Communicate clearly and often at each stage of recommending and&#xD;
    deploying improvements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Monitor improvements&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Confirm successful adoption of improvements by monitoring project performance. THe people using the process are the&#xD;
    real experts. Their experiences and feedback should be captured and incorporated back into the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common Pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Spending too much time and resources developing extensive process-related material&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Think 'return-on-investment' when you introduce capability improvements. Focus on those things that will pay back more&#xD;
    than the investment.&amp;nbsp; There are three major problems with developing extensive process descriptions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        People do not read extensive descriptions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Doing everything right from the beginning is very difficult. It is&amp;nbsp;better to do something less extensive, try&#xD;
        it out, and then adjust it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It removes the focus from mentoring. People with process knowledge need to have mentoring, not writing extensive&#xD;
        descriptions, assigned as their primary task.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Trying to do it all at once&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common mistake&amp;nbsp;is to deploy many process and tool improvements&amp;nbsp;as a single effort. A &quot;big bang&quot;&#xD;
    introduction forces change onto people and can destabilize projects if resistance is too great. People can lose&#xD;
    motivation, which hampers them from dealing effectively with the complexity of having to learn and apply everything at&#xD;
    once. Typically, someone eventually decides to rectify the situation, most often by reversing the original decision to&#xD;
    implement improvements&amp;nbsp;rather than reassessing the situation and determining the best way forward.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most effective way to reach high levels of adoption is to introduce improvements incrementally based&#xD;
    on&amp;nbsp;business priority&amp;nbsp;and readiness of the organization to change. Introduce those improvements that will&#xD;
    provide the most value to the organization&amp;nbsp;first.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Not keeping people informed and involved&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keeping people informed about the new processes and tools,&amp;nbsp;and involving them in the work&amp;nbsp; is critical to&#xD;
    successful adoption. The greatest threat to any change in an organization is peoples' attitudes towards the change.&#xD;
    Introducing a new process and tools in any organization means that people have to change the way they work. People have&#xD;
    a natural resistance toward change. There's always the risk of falling into a negative spiral, where people's negative&#xD;
    attitudes lead to poorer results which then lead to even more negative attitudes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Lack of training/ mentoring&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Education is necessary for successful capability improvement adoption.&amp;nbsp;People need to understand the new processes&#xD;
    and how to use the new tools. Experience shows that having a mentor help with implementing process and tools&amp;nbsp;in&#xD;
    the context of real work&amp;nbsp;is a key success factor.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Lack of management support&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is a well-known fact that organizational change has to be effected at all levels in an organization, starting with&#xD;
    management. Pilot projects should have visibility at the management level, and part of the organization's commitment to&#xD;
    success is a management team that is willing to participate in implementing new process and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Unclear vision and change drivers&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the business drivers behind the change are not clear, it is difficult to convince people of the value of steps&#xD;
    that must be taken to effect that change. People must know why the organization must change (drivers) and where the&#xD;
    change is leading (vision) in order to build a strong foundation for the implementation.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
