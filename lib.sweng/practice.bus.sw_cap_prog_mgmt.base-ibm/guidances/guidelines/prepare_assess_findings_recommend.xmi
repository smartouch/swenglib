    Analyze results&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analyze the collected information in preparation for formalizing the findings. The general steps are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze the gathered data to look for potential problems/issues and articulate the implications of the problems in&#xD;
        the context of the organization's business model. Make an effort to look beyond symptoms to identify the root cause&#xD;
        of the problems/issues you find. In performing this analysis, one may find ambiguous data among the interviews and&#xD;
        reviewed artifacts. Identify where there are ambiguities and schedule another interview or artifact review to&#xD;
        resolve the ambiguity.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the recommendations and sort them by Short-term, Medium-term and Long-term actions or High, Medium and Low&#xD;
        in terms of impact on business results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During analysis, keep in mind that first impressions can be wrong. It is easy to see symptoms first rather than the&#xD;
        underlying root causes. For example, in doctor-patient relationships, doctors who continually treat symptoms rather&#xD;
        then the root cause issues lose the confidence of patients (and sometimes even lose the patients themselves!).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the interviews, you may have heard many statements that indicate symptoms of underlying problem, such as &quot;We're&#xD;
    always late getting products out the door&quot; or &quot;Our products don't meet user expectations.&quot; You should have probed&#xD;
    beneath these statements to find out why these problems occur, from the interviewee's perspective; if you didn't, you&#xD;
    might have to go back and ask during analysis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Equally important, however, is understanding the business impact of the problems discovered during the interviews, as&#xD;
    this critical to prioritizing your recommendations. For example, during the interviews you may have captured statements&#xD;
    like, &quot;Our problem is that we have no change management process.&quot; The lack of an effective change management process is&#xD;
    actually a root cause to many problems; therefore, in order to appropriately prioritize the problem, you need to know&#xD;
    what sort of impact it has on the business-preferably, a quantifiable impact. It might be that the interviewee felt the&#xD;
    delivered product or application doesn't meet expectations, or it could be that the projects are not able to deliver on&#xD;
    time. If you didn't get this information during the interview, you might have to go back and ask for it during&#xD;
    analysis.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The analysis shouldn't only focus on finding the problems. This can turn out to be a rather negative exercise. There&#xD;
    are three pieces of information that are equally important to capture in the findings and recommendations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What sense of urgency to change exists in the organization? And is this something that is understood and shared&#xD;
        across all levels in the organization?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What things are working well in the development organization? Understanding this is critical, since a change effort&#xD;
        that doesn't respect the things that are working may lose credibility and be perceived as doing more harm than&#xD;
        good.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What behaviors, structures, capabilities, and/or infrastructure represent root causes to why the organization isn't&#xD;
        performing well enough? Note that this is not always just about technical skills, processes, or development tools.&#xD;
        Many times the structure of the organization, its culture, and history can have an equally strong influence.&#xD;
        Although the solutions we provide focus on the former, the latter needs to be recognized in the analysis where&#xD;
        appropriate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During analysis, be careful not to make too much of a single data point, as it could be an aberration and not&#xD;
    reflective of the overall situation. It is&amp;nbsp;helpful to think of one data point as an observation, but a second data&#xD;
    point is needed to corroborate before one begins to have a finding. As you analyze all the information you have&#xD;
    collected, look for these correlated data points and patterns that may be present in the data and that may provide&#xD;
    stronger evidence for your conclusions. If you need to go back and talk to someone to corroborate what seems to be an&#xD;
    important data point, it is&amp;nbsp;usually worth the effort to do so.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Findings are identified by comparing current processes to some standard or known best practices (e.g. the IBM Practice&#xD;
    Library, or CMMI for Development).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Prepare findings and recommendations&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you have reviewed the process assets, available measurement data, interview notes, workshop outputs and example&#xD;
    work products, it is time to prepare the assessment findings and recommendations. Here are some key actions to take as&#xD;
    you prepare your recommendations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review assessment findings with stakeholders and key people to ensure correctness.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify any areas that require further research (e.g. a referenced process website or further key work products&#xD;
        that were not originally inspected or available)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rank the findings and recommendations by their business impact and provide information on specific benefit gained&#xD;
        by implementing the recommendations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the findings and recommendations fulfill the original objectives of the assessment and are within its&#xD;
        scope.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provide adequate supporting evidence in the detailed assessment report.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make sure to include both organizational strengths and areas to improve in the context of the&amp;nbsp;assessment&#xD;
    report&amp;nbsp;(usually the five best practices). You should include detailed analysis using specific examples derived&#xD;
    from the interview sessions (while leaving out specific names of individuals who may have provided the information);&#xD;
    this is necessary to create a credible report.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Avoid expressing findings in the manner of recommendations. Findings represent a current &quot;state&quot;. For instance, a&#xD;
    finding of &quot;there is no CCB for approving changes&quot; is almost a de facto recommendation; whereas, the real finding may&#xD;
    be &quot;changes to the code are made on an ad hoc basis using informal communication mechanisms.&quot; With the&#xD;
    first,&amp;nbsp;stakeholders may&amp;nbsp;focus first on what it takes to set up a CCB rather then gain an appreciation of the&#xD;
    business impacts of their current practice. With the second, the stakeholders more readily accept the finding and the&#xD;
    discussion quickly moves to the business risks and impacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Validate assessment findings&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the assessment team has compiled the initial findings and recommendations, they should validate the findings with&#xD;
    stakeholders to make sure that that the findings accurately reflect the organization's situation. Solicit feedback you&#xD;
    receive and update your&amp;nbsp;findings as appropriate. This step is very important, as it not only gives your&#xD;
    stakeholders an opportunity to ask questions and express concerns, but also gives you an opportunity to validate the&#xD;
    findings, correct any misconceptions or errors, and to ensure that the manner in which you are presenting the findings&#xD;
    will be acceptable to the larger audience of stakeholders and management.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Prepare the deployment roadmap&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;roadmap (along with implementation strategy and plan) should include a complete solution composed of process&#xD;
    assets,&amp;nbsp;tools, needed training/ mentoring.. Once you have the first draft of the plan, you should collaboratively&#xD;
    refine it to arrive at a final version. Be sure to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Accurately summarize the key assessment findings into an executive summary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Present findings in roadmap format proposing incremental improvements. In most cases, you will not replace the&#xD;
        software development process currently in practice in the organization. You will implement the new development&#xD;
        process step-by-step, focusing on the more critical and important areas first. Some of the current software&#xD;
        development process may even continue to exist for some time, perhaps forever. Outline: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                what activities are to be performed&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                benefits of process and tool improvements&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                include schedules, deliverables, estimated costs, risks, and constraints.&lt;br />&#xD;
                &lt;br />&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
