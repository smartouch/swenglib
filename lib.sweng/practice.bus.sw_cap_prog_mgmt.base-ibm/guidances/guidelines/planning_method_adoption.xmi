  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Consider the effects of process change&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Process changes are difficult and it may take time to see their true effects. It can be relatively easy and fast to&#xD;
    adopt a new too. You install it, read the user's guide, go through an example, and maybe attend a training course. This&#xD;
    transition can last from a few hours to several weeks. However, changing the software development process often means&#xD;
    affecting the fundamental beliefs and values of the individuals involved, changing the way they perceive their work,&#xD;
    and how they perceive its value. It is a cultural change that is almost political or philosophical in nature.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A process change affects the individuals and the organization more deeply than changing technology or tools. It must be&#xD;
    carefully planned and managed. The adopting organization must identify the opportunity and the benefits, convey them&#xD;
    clearly to the interested parties, raise their level of awareness, and then gradually change from the current practice&#xD;
    to a new one. Ivar Jacobson describes this as &quot;reengineering your software engineering process.&quot;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The following areas must be addressed when implementing a process:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The people and their competencies, skills, motivation, and attitude: everyone needs to be adequately trained and&#xD;
        motivated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The supporting tools: new tools will inevitably replace old ones, requiring customization and integration with the&#xD;
        others&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The software development life cycle model, its dependent organizational structure, underlying activities, and&#xD;
        practices together with the artifacts that are produced&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actual description of the software development process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are other areas in addition to those mentioned above that affect the way people work. For example, the physical&#xD;
    working environment, organizational culture and politics, and the reward structure.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In addition to those people inside the software development organization, you must also take into consideration the&#xD;
    people outside of that organization who will be affected by these changes, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Managers, who are responsible for the performance of the software development organization, must understand why the&#xD;
        process is being changed and why new tools are being procured. It is important that they understand how, and if,&#xD;
        progress is being made. Any process improvement project must have executive support. Management needs to understand&#xD;
        that a return on the investment is being made in changing the process and also that expectations need to be&#xD;
        carefully managed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customers may need to be informed that the organizational process has changed because it could affect how and when&#xD;
        their input will be addressed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other parts of the software development organization may also be affected. Sometimes changes in one part of the&#xD;
        organization may lead to resistance and skepticism from other parts of the organization. The reason is often that&#xD;
        they don't understand the reasons for the changes. Even if they don't have a direct influence, it may cause&#xD;
        political problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Attitudes&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Negative attitudes among an organization's personnel toward changing to a new technology, a new process or new tools is&#xD;
    probably the biggest threat toward the successful implementation of process and tools. Over-enthusiasm toward process&#xD;
    can also be a problem, because it can cause people to focus too much on the process.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    To assess people's attitudes towards the new technology, process, and tools ask questions like:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What benefits do you see with the new technology? Will the new technology solve any of today's problems? What&#xD;
        problems do you see with the new technology?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What benefits do you see with the new process? Will the new process solve any of today's problems? What problems do&#xD;
        you see with the new process?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What benefits do you see with the new tools? Will the new tools solve any of today's problems? What problems do you&#xD;
        see with the new tools?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To assess people's motivation, find answers to questions like:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Does everybody in the organization see why change is needed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is everybody aware of what their competition is doing and how that affects the business?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is everybody aware of technology changes in the industry and how they affect the business?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Signs of a negative attitude may include statements like these:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Process doesn't help, it hinders.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Process means producing a lot of documents.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;The process is overwhelming.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Some ways to handle negative attitudes are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Motivate people by pointing at today's problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain that a process doesn't dictate what you should do. The process must primarily be looked upon as a &quot;help&#xD;
        system&quot;, where you look for guidance, definitions, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain that you only use small sections of the process. Nobody can master the entire process, and that is not the&#xD;
        purpose. Compare the process to a bookshelf of books you read as you need their information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Run a successful pilot project where you show that the new process and tools work. Include one or two skeptics in&#xD;
        the pilot project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Signs of over-enthusiasm include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        People rely completely on the process and think it will solve all of their problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process is the silver bullet or magic formula that, if followed, will guarantee success.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The project team wants to spend a lot of time and effort tailoring the process without first assessing the&#xD;
        process-related problems that need resolution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Some ways to handle over-enthusiasm are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Set expectations. The process will help, but it will not solve the problems. People solve problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Talk people out of spending a lot of time tailoring the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focus people on developing the software products.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Introduce improvements incrementally&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most cases, you will not&amp;nbsp;replace the software delivery process currently in practice in the&#xD;
    organization.&amp;nbsp;You will&amp;nbsp;implement the new delivery process step-by-step, focusing on the more critical and&#xD;
    important areas first. Some of the current software&amp;nbsp;delivery process may even continue to exist for some time,&#xD;
    perhaps forever.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
