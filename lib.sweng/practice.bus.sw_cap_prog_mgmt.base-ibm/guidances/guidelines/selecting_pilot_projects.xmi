  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of a pilot project is not only to deliver a product, but also to apply new process, technology, or tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Requirements&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Important requirements&amp;nbsp;for selecting the right pilot project&amp;nbsp;include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Manageable Technical Risk&lt;/strong>. A pilot project should not involve too much technical risk, although risk&#xD;
    is difficult to avoid when you are introducing a combination of new process, tools, and technology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>High Priority&lt;/strong>. The project should have a high enough priority to ensure necessary management&#xD;
    commitment and sufficient resources. A mission-critical project would certainly meet this criterion but also carry a&#xD;
    high cost of failure (financial risk).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Committed Resources&lt;/strong>. Many pilot projects fail when their resources are reassigned to other projects or&#xD;
    their budgets are cut. Managers should commit sufficient resources for the duration of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Realistic Schedule&lt;/strong>. The project schedule must not be so constrained that the team must forego the&#xD;
    adoption of process and tools in order to meet it. Usually, the project manager is given some extra time to complete&#xD;
    the project (ten to twenty-five percent of the&amp;nbsp;original schedule).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Considerations&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the pilot project has been started before the introduction of new process or tools, care must be taken to ensure&#xD;
    the improvements can be introduced at the right time. If the project is in Inception or early elaboration, there is&#xD;
    usually enough time to introduce process and tools without jeopardizing the delivery date.&amp;nbsp; Waiting to introduce a&#xD;
    new process or tools at a later stage will destabilize the project, as the project team's focus will shift to&#xD;
    accommodating the changes.&amp;nbsp; This may lead to delayed delivery of the project, and in some cases could even lead to&#xD;
    project termination if the team becomes swamped in complexity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most straightforward approach is to introduce improvements upon project startup.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To get the most out of a pilot project, it is&amp;nbsp;important that the pilot uses the real development environment and&#xD;
    that there is a real project pressure.&#xD;
