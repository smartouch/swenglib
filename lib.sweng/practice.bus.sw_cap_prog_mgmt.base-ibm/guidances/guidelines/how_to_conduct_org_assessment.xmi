    Gather information&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective is to identify how the organization current approaches software delivery. Information can be gathered&#xD;
    through several methods:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyzing the outcome of previous assessments and projects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interviews with stakeholders and key people&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reviews of current software delivery process assets and project artifacts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Conduct a kickoff meeting&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Kick off the assessment with stakeholders and key people by giving an overview of the assessment goals and activities.&#xD;
    Confirm the scope of the assessment and ask key representatives to give an overview of current software delivery&#xD;
    processes. This meeting should not be overly formal or take too much time. A focused 1-2 hour session is usually&#xD;
    sufficient.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to request feedback during and after the session about the approach for conducting the&#xD;
    assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Conduct interviews&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective of conducting interviews is to gather detailed information about how teams across the organization&#xD;
    performs software delivery activities, so that you can analyze strengths and weaknesses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Preparing for the interviews&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before you begin the interviews, confirm the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interview schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Names of those who will conduct each interview and note takers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List of interview questions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tools used to record responses, such as:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Voice recorders&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Mind mapping tools e.g. MindManager, Freemind&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Microsoft&amp;reg; Word&amp;reg; or Excel&amp;reg;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Software Architect, Rational&amp;reg; RequisitePro&amp;reg;, SoDa&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will you structure the results report (e.g. by practice, discipline, priority)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Probe for actual processes&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remember that documented processes may not actually be implemented. Those in use on real projects may be quite&#xD;
    different. As you conduct interviews with project teams, confirm that you review real project artifacts and discuss the&#xD;
    actual process followed to create them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During each interview, confirm the following the interviewee:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The interviewee's&amp;nbsp;roles and responsibilities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other roles they interact with to perform their responsibilities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Processes performed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Their opinion on the top 5 problems that currently prevent them to perform their job most effectively.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improvements they think are most worthwhile.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Processes they perform.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is currently working well and&amp;nbsp;should not be changed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Follow the&amp;nbsp;list of specific questions prepared in advance that are based on the particular role of the&#xD;
    interviewee. However, be prepared to &quot;go off-script&quot; if the interview leads in a direction that you did not anticipate&#xD;
    but is providing useful information.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In interviewing people who are in roles that are above the project level, devote more time within the interview to&#xD;
    better understand business drivers and the basic business model. Managers can have differing viewpoints, and executive&#xD;
    visions are not always implemented cohesively throughout an organization. You can use the interview questions template&#xD;
    to guide you in what questions to ask.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Put interviewees at ease&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some interviewees&amp;nbsp;may see an assessment interview as a threat. They may not be following the prescribed process&#xD;
    (many times, for good reason). To be able to capture this type of insight, the interviewees must be comfortable with&#xD;
    the interview and be confident that their work habits and views will not have an adverse affect on them.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    With this in mind, prepare an interview environment that helps put them at ease:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The interview setting should be in a private area, such as a conference room that has been reserved for the&#xD;
        interviews.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain that the purpose of the interview is to assess the current state of affairs and that specific&#xD;
        recommendation for improvement will be presented as a result of the assessment. Any interviewees who were not at&#xD;
        the kickoff meeting may not have a clue as to why managers asked them to meet with you.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assure the interviewees that no one will be identified as the source of any specific comments.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assure the interviewees that there may be questions that they may not be able to answer, and that is OK. They also&#xD;
        may not have data at hand to back up their answers, and that is also OK, but tell them that you will need to get&#xD;
        the data later.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain that you will be taking notes, but that these are for the assessment purposes only and will not be shared&#xD;
        outside of the assessment team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Let the interviewees know that they will be given an opportunity at the end of the interviews to ask questions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain the type and form of feedback that they should expect to receive as a result of their participation&#xD;
        (Findings Presentation, Assessment Report).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Probing for business impact&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During interviews, it is easy to see symptoms first rather than the underlying root causes.&amp;nbsp;It is important&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;uncover the root causes of the problems, inhibitors to success, and the business impact of those problems to be&#xD;
    able to prepare credible and compelling findings and recommendations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Sometimes, you will hear statements that indicate a symptom of an underlying problem, such as &quot;We're always late&#xD;
    getting our products out the door&quot; or &quot;Our products don't meet user expectations.&quot; You need to probe beneath those&#xD;
    statements to find out why these problems occur, at least from the interviewee's perspective. Try to corroborate what&#xD;
    you have found by asking other people, in subsequent interviews, who might see the same problem from another&#xD;
    perspective.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Other times, you will hear statements that directly express a root cause, such as, &quot;Our problem is that we have no&#xD;
    change management process.&quot; The lack of an effective change management process is actually a root cause to many&#xD;
    problems; therefore, to appropriately prioritize the problem, you need to know what sort of impact it has on the&#xD;
    business. It might be that the interviewee felt the delivered product or application didn't meet expectations, or it&#xD;
    could be that the project teams are not able to deliver on time. If you can get the person to quantify the impact of&#xD;
    the problem, all the better.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Be aware that when you hear someone state that something is a problem, it might not be accurate. They may have a change&#xD;
    process, but not be aware of it, not agree with it, or simply not be part of it. Take any suggested solutions&#xD;
    seriously, but be sure to verify the information with many interviewees.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    You can also probe the interviewees for their opinions on who in the organization is most affected by this problem.&#xD;
    That can lead to additional stakeholders who were not on the original list of interviewees but might be able to provide&#xD;
    valuable insight.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Closing questions&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When closing&amp;nbsp;the interviews, be sure to give the interviewees a chance to express or summarize their opinions of&#xD;
    what changes should and should not be made. Answers to these questions can contribute directly to your key findings in&#xD;
    terms of &quot;areas for improvement&quot; and &quot;areas of strength.&quot; You can ask, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        From your vantage point, what changes, if implemented, would have the most significant positive impact on your&#xD;
        area?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As the organization moves forward, what areas of strength would you like to see preserved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Review development environment&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Project artifacts&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review multiple representative samples of each key artifact if at all possible.&amp;nbsp;It is best to not only determine&#xD;
    the state, organization, coherence, and clarity of process definition, but also the state, quality, consistency, and&#xD;
    compliance of the related templates and artifacts. This can provide a more objective structure for point-based&#xD;
    evaluations according to dimensions derived from these characteristics.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In collecting types of artifacts for review, consider the following categories:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process or methodology definitions and procedural guidelines&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Planning and management artifacts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Policy and governance documents&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measurements and metrics&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Status and reporting artifacts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training materials and user documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you review project artifacts, look at the structure of the artifact and whether it conforms, at least in spirit, to&#xD;
    the defined process. Try to get answers to these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the process for controlling or tracking changes to artifacts?&amp;nbsp;What is the&amp;nbsp;change control board&#xD;
        for project artifacts?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the artifacts are managed in a digital repository or available only on paper?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is each artifact used to add value to their project or just to put a &quot;check in the box&quot; to satisfy the process&#xD;
        requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the artifacts are a by-product of development or the focus of the development? For example, are&amp;nbsp;teams&#xD;
        spending a lot of time writing documents rather than building the application?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the artifacts created as an integral part of the process or as &quot;after the fact&quot; documentation of the process?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can&amp;nbsp;teams automatically trace artifacts from one development phase to another (requirements mapped to test&#xD;
        cases and so forth)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the processes and artifacts consistent across projects and departments? For example, does one project have a&#xD;
        very different requirement set than another project?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Just scan the artifacts. You don't have time for an in-depth review, and that is not the purpose of the&#xD;
    assessment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Consolidate the interview results&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The assessment team analyzes the interview data and supplementary information to produce the initial findings and&#xD;
    recommendations. Ambiguities in the findings may necessitate follow-up interviews or access to artifacts. Two key&#xD;
    activities are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze and consolidate interview results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create assessment findings and validate in order to gain consensus.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify any areas that require further research (e.g. a referenced process website or further key work products that&#xD;
    were not originally inspected or available).&lt;br />&#xD;
    Have sufficient domain expertise available in the assessment team to perform the best practice gap analysis when&#xD;
    preparing interview findings.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
