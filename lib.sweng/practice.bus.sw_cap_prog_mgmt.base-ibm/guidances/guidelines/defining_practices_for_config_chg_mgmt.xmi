  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Change Management and Configuration Management are closely related process areas. Change management is the process of&#xD;
    planning and coordinating the implementation of product changes in a planned, authorized, logical, and orderly fashion.&#xD;
    It does not develop changes, nor does it implement them. Configuration Management is the process of controlling and&#xD;
    synchronizing the evolution of the set of work products composing a software system&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to understand the impact of changes and to plan for verification, change requests must identify which versions&#xD;
    of which artifacts were affected by the change. A common problem with stand-alone change management practices and tools&#xD;
    is a lack of traceability to the affected configuration items. For this reason, it is critical to integrate your&#xD;
    Configuration Management and Change Management processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Change and Configuration management are also related to Product Integration. The purpose of this process area is to&#xD;
    incrementally assemble the product from its components, ensuring&amp;nbsp;that the integrated product functions properly.&#xD;
    Milestone builds and releases must have traceability to all implemented changes and their associated configuration&#xD;
    items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reference the following&amp;nbsp;typical activities and key considerations for&amp;nbsp;these three process areas as you define&#xD;
    practices&amp;nbsp;for your organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Configuration Management&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identification of&amp;nbsp;configuration items&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations should specify which work products and what parts of work products should be placed under configuration&#xD;
    management, and what specific controls are required, and when those controls are applied.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One way to represent this is with a table that lists work products or parts of work products, and lists the type of&#xD;
    configuration control required, and in what phase they are placed under configuration control.&amp;nbsp; A separate&#xD;
    guideline (or practice) then describes the different types of configuration control, if there is more than one.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    You may also wish to specify how configuration controls change for a single work product through different phases of&#xD;
    the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another approach is to have a general policy that can be used to determine whether work products need to be under&#xD;
    configuration control.&amp;nbsp; For example, you might just mandate that all project deliverables are placed under&#xD;
    configuration control, rather than have a separate table.&amp;nbsp; You might also have a policy that says project&#xD;
    deliverables are placed under configuration control in the phase where they are first formally reviewed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Levels of configuration control&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typical levels of configuration control on projects are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        No controls - this typically applies to work products that have no long-term value, such as results of&#xD;
        brainstorming efforts, throw away prototypes, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Version control only - in this case, you may capture past versions of a work product, but not have any controls on&#xD;
        what changes are made, by who, or why.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Naming conventions&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations may wish to specify naming conventions for different kinds of configuration items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Configuration management audits&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the policies for configuration audits.&amp;nbsp;These audits ensure&amp;nbsp;that the system satisfies the specified&#xD;
    requirements, including all approved change requests, and nothing more.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Configuration management environments&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations should specify tools and tooling configurations that automate the configuration management process and&#xD;
    enforce configuration management policies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This includes the following.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Role authorization and notification&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may wish to limit access to certain kinds of information to particular project roles.&amp;nbsp; For example, project&#xD;
    plans may not be available to customer representatives directly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Project plans&amp;nbsp;may be updateable only&#xD;
    by the project manager.&amp;nbsp; You may also set up automatic notifications so that certain roles are notified when&#xD;
    configurations items are changed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The level of controls applied may be different for different project types.&amp;nbsp; For example, you may wish to have a&#xD;
    high trust environment with very few controls in order to encourage high levels of collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Archival policies and mechanisms&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Certain work products may be important to archive for metrics, compliance, or other reasons.&amp;nbsp; These may be&#xD;
    identified using a table that lists work products that need to be archived.&amp;nbsp; Or you may have a general policy to&#xD;
    identify which items to archive, such as &quot;archive all configuration controlled items&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Product directory structure&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations may propose one or more standard product directory structures to organize configuration items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Baselining&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may wish to establish policies on who can create a baseline, what kinds of work products are included, and what&#xD;
    approvals are required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Baselines should be created from approved configuration items only.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Change management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>Define Change Management practices to provide project teams with explicit approaches for controlling changes,&#xD;
including defining states for&amp;nbsp;change requests&amp;nbsp;and tasks for transitioning change requests&amp;nbsp;between their&#xD;
specified states. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good rule of thumb is to have as much formality as you require, and no more. Generally, it is most efficient to&#xD;
    minimize formal change control to highly visible features, and allow the project team to manage lower-level details&#xD;
    with a minimum of overhead. Organizations typically define a formal Change Management practice and an informal Change&#xD;
    Management practice so that teams&amp;nbsp;can select the most appropriate approach for their project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An informal practice provides a simple change management process&amp;nbsp;which is integrated into project management&#xD;
    activities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this approach, any&amp;nbsp;team member may&amp;nbsp;request a change to the system (or supporting&#xD;
    artifacts) at any time, either to correct a defect identified or to add an enhancement. The request for change is&#xD;
    captured&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;backlog.&amp;nbsp;During project planning the team reviews the backlog, prioritizes work, and&#xD;
    decides which changes will be implemented next. A more formal practice is used when additional governance is needed in&#xD;
    the Change Management process&amp;nbsp;when&amp;nbsp;there is a group of stakeholders outside the project team that needs to&#xD;
    approve and verify certain kinds of changes or changes need to be tightly controlled (such as late in an iteration or&#xD;
    release cycle) for stabilization purposes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Confirm your Change Management practices address the following concerns:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        work products and kinds of changes that are controlled by the practice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        change request types (e.g. defect, enhancement request).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        change request states (e.g. approved, assigned, deferred).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        how often are changes reviewed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        what roles participate in the change-request process?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        what metrics are tracked?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Product integration&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Integration practices help teams progressively assemble the product components in incremental stages according&#xD;
    to a specified integration strategy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Enterprise policies for product integration prevent:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        subsystems that don't integrate/ operate together.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        installing a product that does not integrate with the customer's production systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        delayed testing and increased integration times.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establish enterprise procedures and the environments required to support the integration of product components.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product integration environments&amp;nbsp;may include equipment for testing and simulation, production hardware and&#xD;
        other devices.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make build or buy decisions based on the the availability of existing organizational resources and the enterprise&#xD;
        product integration strategy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Practices for the integration of product components&amp;nbsp;typically describe such procedures as the types of tests&#xD;
        to be carried out at each stage, criteria for managing interface descriptions and repositories, and guidelines for&#xD;
        determining system build procedures.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create tailoring guidelines describing how projects can tailor their project-specific process and integration&#xD;
        environment (including build/ buy decisions).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
