    The following are typical activities and key considerations for&amp;nbsp;verification to reference as you define&#xD;
    practices&amp;nbsp;for your organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specify&amp;nbsp;the types of testing and verification techniques teams will use to&amp;nbsp;confirm the selected work&#xD;
        products meet their specified requirements. Create practices for each method, describing&amp;nbsp;when each type is&#xD;
        relevant and appropriate along&amp;nbsp;with the typical output work products that must be produced. Typical&#xD;
        verification techniques include inspections, walkthroughs, demonstrations, testing, simulations, and reviews.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify what training material is needed for each verification method.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Address the environments required to support the recommended verification processes and policies (e.g. equipment,&#xD;
        testing environment tools and components).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the specific types of reviews (e.g. peer reviews, pair programming)&amp;nbsp;that will be performed for&#xD;
        verification of work products. Describe the specific objectives for each type of review, who will be involved, and&#xD;
        what preparation is required. Describe the data required as entry and exit criteria for each type of review.&#xD;
        Provide examples as guidance for project teams.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify verification techniques that apply prior to final integration&amp;nbsp;and delivery of the product. These&#xD;
        typically include stress, operational scenario,&amp;nbsp;load, and performance testing.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe the incremental process teams will follow to verify the product, beginning with the verification of&#xD;
        requirements, through the verification of evolving work products, and finally in verifying the completed product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create tailoring guidelines describing how projects can develop project-specific content for the tailored process.&#xD;
        This typically involves creating checklists as exit criteria for the verification of work products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe how to analyze verification results so that teams can take corrective actions as needed.&amp;nbsp;Specify how&#xD;
        to analyze defect data and identify issues with methods, procedures, verification criteria, and the verification&#xD;
        environment.These analysis results also&amp;nbsp;serve as evidence that verification was conducted. Associate metrics&#xD;
        with verification practices to monitor improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
