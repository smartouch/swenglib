    Phased Approach&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implementing software development process and tools&amp;nbsp;in an organization is a complex task and needs to be done in a&#xD;
    controlled manner. We recommend treating it as a project that is external to or is a sub-project of your&#xD;
    software&amp;nbsp;capability improvement&amp;nbsp;program. Set up milestones, allocate resources, and manage it as you would&#xD;
    any other project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process-implementation project is divided into a number of phases where all four steps are performed in each phase&#xD;
    until the project is ready and the process and tools are deployed and successfully used by the entire organization as&#xD;
    shown in the following figure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./resources/impplan.gif&quot; width=&quot;562&quot; height=&quot;116&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A process-implementation project can be divided into phases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following table gives a general idea of how a project can be planned with four phases.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;table&#xD;

        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;th width=&quot;13%&quot;>&#xD;
                Relative Phase&#xD;
            &lt;/th>&#xD;
            &lt;th width=&quot;30%&quot;>&#xD;
                Purpose&#xD;
            &lt;/th>&#xD;
            &lt;th width=&quot;58%&quot;>&#xD;
                Important results after the phase&#xD;
            &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;>&#xD;
                Phase 1&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;>&#xD;
                To sell the process-implementation project to the sponsors&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;58%&quot;>&#xD;
                A go or no-go decision from the sponsors. To support the decision, the tools may be demonstrated and a the&#xD;
                process may be exemplified.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;>&#xD;
                Phase 2&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;>&#xD;
                To handle the major risks&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;58%&quot;>&#xD;
                A demonstrable prototype of the customer's software development environment is ready, including tools,&#xD;
                templates, guidelines, and examples of processes.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;>&#xD;
                Phase 3&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;>&#xD;
                To complete everything&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;58%&quot;>&#xD;
                Completion of the customers software development environment including integration, test, and demonstration&#xD;
                of its usage. All tools are ready to use. Templates, guidelines, and examples of processes are ready, a&#xD;
                training curriculum is ready, and mentors are ready to start supporting the real projects through the next&#xD;
                phase.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;>&#xD;
                Phase 4&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;>&#xD;
                To deploy it to the entire organization&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;58%&quot;>&#xD;
                Process and tools are deployed to the entire organization.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A project to implement process and tools in an organization has many similarities to a software development project. It&#xD;
    has even been suggested that the phases above are named Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition as they&#xD;
    are for a software development project using the Rational Unified Process. However, we recommend that you do not use&#xD;
    the same names on the phases to avoid any confusion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Planning Milestones&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    When you define the content and goals of the milestones, keep the following guidelines in mind:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            Keep the final vision in mind.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            Reduce major risks early.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            Focus on major problem areas early.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            Select those areas where you can make some easy gains early.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Planning Considerations&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Some typical factors and how they can affect the plans are provided below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            Problems in the current development process. Focus on those areas of the development process where the&#xD;
            organization has problems today. Focus on areas where you can expect some easy results and where people can see&#xD;
            the benefits early. Make sure the first iterations focus on an area where you know you will address and solve&#xD;
            one of the major problems in today's organization.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            The need for change in the current organization. If there are lots of problems in the organization-with the&#xD;
            tools or the way people work-the frustration level in the organization will be high. In this case, you can be&#xD;
            more aggressive and employ the new process and tools, or parts of them, in real projects.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            The capacity for change in the current organization. If they are either unaccustomed to change or currently&#xD;
            overwhelmed by it, the goals of the first few iterations should be modest. In this case, the primary objective&#xD;
            should be to build credibility and confidence in the process, with more intrusive changes reserved for later&#xD;
            iterations when they can be more easily accommodated. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
            href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.sw_cap_prog_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/managing_org_change_46D3611F.html&quot;&#xD;
            guid=&quot;_cBlnQG23Ed-vK5B6ZgVtPg&quot;>Concept: Managing Organizational Change&lt;/a>&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            The size of the organization. If the organization using the process and tools is large, be sure that the&#xD;
            process and the tools are stable enough to be used by many developers. In this case, be more careful by&#xD;
            implementing the process and supporting tools during several iterations in one or more software development&#xD;
            projects.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            The risks involved. If they are small, be more aggressive and start using the process and tools in new projects&#xD;
            earlier. If the risks are large, be more careful and use pilot projects to verify the process and the tools.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            The attitude among people in the organization. Communicate the problems with today's organization and how it's&#xD;
            working. If current personnel understand today's problems, it will be easier to accept and understand the need&#xD;
            for change. Involve those people outside of the immediately affected part of the organization.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Do not try to do everything all at once. Instead, divide the implementation into a number of increments and, in each&#xD;
    one, implement a portion of the new process together with the supporting tools. Typically, focus on one of the areas&#xD;
    where you believe the change will have the most impact. For example, if the software development organization is weak&#xD;
    in testing, you may start by introducing&amp;nbsp;Test practices&amp;nbsp;with tools that automate testing. However, if the&#xD;
    organization is weak in capturing or managing requirements, start by introducing Requirements practices together with&#xD;
    its supporting tools.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Implement the process and tools in iterations of software development projects whether in pilot projects or real&#xD;
    projects. The purpose is to verify the process and the tools in as real an environment as possible. Consider the&#xD;
    following points when you select software development projects and iterations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            If the goal is to implement the process and tools in one single software development project, decide to&#xD;
            implement the process and tools in that one project, then monitor and improve the process as the project&#xD;
            continues.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            If the goal is to implement the process and tools in a large organization over many projects, consider&#xD;
            implementing and verifying the process and tools in iterations over several phases. In that case, choose a&#xD;
            relatively small project where you can apply the process and tools during the whole lifecycle of a software&#xD;
            project.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
            If the improvements&amp;nbsp;represent a significant departure from your current software engineering process, if&#xD;
            you need to get a better handle on the risks and advantages of introducing the new process or if you are in a&#xD;
            new organization with little or no process in place, try them out&amp;nbsp;on a mini-project or a pilot project&#xD;
            before applying it to your major, mission-critical development project.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    information about implementation approaches.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The use of a new process, new tools, and possibly new technology in a software project makes the project's schedule&#xD;
    more volatile. Be sure to allocate time and resources to implement the process, train people, and so on during the&#xD;
    iteration in the software-development project where you start using the process and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Top Reasons for Failure&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to understand these top reasons for failure:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Failure to incrementally implement process and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lack of management support.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lack of bringing stakeholders on board. All stakeholders affected by the new process and tools must be onboard,&#xD;
        including customers, other department, and sub-contractors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lack of willingness or ability to deal with organizational change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These reasons focus on non-technical issues, which is exactly what our experience shows.&#xD;
