  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations must change in order to keep pace with the changing environment around them. Change offers advantages,&#xD;
    such as giving the organization the opportunity to adopt emerging practices to maximize efficiency, productivity, and&#xD;
    achieve or exceed organizational goals. Freezing the organization simply causes the necessary changes to pile up until&#xD;
    they cause a crisis.&amp;nbsp; Continuous management of change minimizes risks to the organization, while allowing the&#xD;
    organization to reap the benefits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    People resist change. Whether due to inertia or fear of the unknown, people will often actively oppose change, or at&#xD;
    least slow it down to what they feel is a manageable pace. In order to change an organization, you must understand&#xD;
    these forces and channel them to enable rather than oppose change.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &quot;Nothing is more difficult than to introduce a new order. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have&#xD;
        done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.&quot; - NiccolÃ²&#xD;
        Machiavelli, 1513 A.D.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In its simplest form, we view the forces of change as a formula:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>pain + desire = change&lt;/b>&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The fundamental tenet of this formula is that ultimately change is driven by emotions. Pain and desire are the forces&#xD;
    that drive us to make a change and to accept it. Pain is the catalyst that initiates a change, whereas desire is the&#xD;
    force that pulls us towards a goal. A successful transition entails understanding and managing the perceived level of&#xD;
    pain and the desire for a solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pain management identifies and communicates what the real problem is and why it's necessary to change. Sometimes&#xD;
    finding the root cause of a problem can be very hard yet, in the final analysis, it's very valuable to initiate the&#xD;
    change. It has been our experience that many of the root causes of problems are in the process or, rather, in the&#xD;
    absence of process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remedy selling contains two activities-solution selling and transition planning. It isn't enough to describe the ideal&#xD;
    goal. To define a solution, you also need to have a path from the current point to that goal with some clearly defined&#xD;
    intermediate points.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The change will not happen just because management says so. You must identify the agents of change-that set of&#xD;
    individuals who will take on the mission to make the change happen.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The change agents must understand the pain, formulate the real nature of the problem, and communicate it to the&#xD;
    organization so it becomes very aware of its pain. Then, the change agents must formulate and describe both the goal,&#xD;
    and the path to the goal, and again communicate it to the various parts of the organization. This communication is&#xD;
    complicated. It is too easy to generalize about both problems and solutions. &quot;Everybody must be a team player&quot; is a&#xD;
    sweeping generalization about how individuals need to act, however, it does little to initiate change. To affect&#xD;
    change, the change agents-the champions-must communicate in terms of tangible, quantifiable activities. J. Jellison&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;speaks about levels of language using the analogy of an airplane pilot's view from different altitudes above the&#xD;
    ground:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At 30,000 feet-indictment of ability:&lt;br />&#xD;
        The focus will only be on the problem, or even symptoms of the problems, not on the solution. &quot;The development&#xD;
        group does not have a sufficient understanding of object technology.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At 20,000 feet-high level solution:&lt;br />&#xD;
        Still very few concrete things with which to start any action. &quot;You need to improve communication between teams.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At 10,000 feet: specific actions but no qualification of scope.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &quot;Construct a use case model to capture the functional requirements of the next generation system.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At ground level-concrete requests:&lt;br />&#xD;
        Actions and measurements are communicated. At this level, you are down to exactly what the organization needs to&#xD;
        do. &quot;The design of each subsystem will contain from 1 to 3 class diagrams, with some 7 to 10 classes.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The correct ground level naturally depends on to whom in the organization the message is addressed. The real value of a&#xD;
    change agent is to be able to understand the overall solution, and then to articulate each step using ground level&#xD;
    language and focusing on one change at a time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To successfully implement a process change, the adopting organization must:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify change agents at various levels in the organizations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plan the change in small, reasonable, and measurable steps.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communicate the changes using ground level language appropriate to the level of organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process implementation plan is used when you change the process.&#xD;
