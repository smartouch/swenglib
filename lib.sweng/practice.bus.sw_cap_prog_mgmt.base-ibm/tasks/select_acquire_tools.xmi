  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many of the steps in&amp;nbsp;a defined&amp;nbsp;process can only be efficiently carried on with the proper tool support. Tools&#xD;
    need to be selected that fit the particular needs of an organization, based mostly on specific tasks or work products&#xD;
    necessary for the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes special tools have to be developed internally to support special needs, provide additional automation of&#xD;
    tedious or error-prone tasks, and provide better integration between tools. This tool development may proceed with a&#xD;
    lighter weight delivery process than the one used for developing the product.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Selecting and acquiring the tools is done in hand-in-hand with the definition and implementation of processes in the&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tools are only as good as the process they automate. And, they are useful only in the hands of skilled people. When&#xD;
    teams do not have the proper training to make the best use of tools, projects are often hindered rather than helped.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider adoption and deployment issues carefully when selecting tools for capability improvement. Ensure cost does not&#xD;
    outweigh the benefits.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify what the needs for tool support are, and what the constraints are, by looking at the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The delivery process. What tool support is required to effectively work. For example, if the organization decides&#xD;
        to employ an iterative delivery process, it is necessary to automate the tests, since you will be testing several&#xD;
        times during the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operational objectives. How can tool support help you meet these objectives?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Host (or development) platform(s).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Target platform(s).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The programming language(s) to be used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Existing tools. Evaluate any existing and proven tools and decide whether they can continue to be used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The distribution of the development organization. Is the organization physically distributed? Development tools&#xD;
        generally support a physically distributed organization differently.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The size of development efforts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Budget and time constraints.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    Collect information about the candidate tools and their vendors. Some of this information is data that can be collected&#xD;
    from the vendor, or from independent reviews.&#xD;

    To combine the factors and select the best tools is not a trivial issue. Compare tool features, functions, cost and&#xD;
    vendor information. &amp;nbsp;See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select the tools that best fulfill your needs, and can fit within your constraints. Do not fall into the trap of&#xD;
    comparing features and functions only. The other criteria are equally, or more important. Unless the choice of tool is&#xD;
    obvious, we recommend that you test the tool (or tools) that you have found to best suit your needs, before you decide&#xD;
    to acquire it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If there are any doubts about the tool, the best is always to test the tool. You can also try to find other companies&#xD;
    that are using the tool, and ask them if they can evaluate the tool. You can also ask for reference customers from the&#xD;
    vendors; other customers who are using the tool. There is also information available on the Internet, where for example&#xD;
    online magazines publish their reviews.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you have made the choice, stick to it. To change tool in the middle of a project or capability&amp;nbsp;improvement&#xD;
    program is often very costly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document your specific&amp;nbsp;tool recommendations in the recommendations section of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To acquire tools is a non-trivial issue, which involves legal matters as well as financial matters. Tool acquisition is&#xD;
    not covered in any detail here. The following areas should be considered: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation. How much assistance do they offer to set up the tools?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support. What kind of support do the vendor offer? Many tool vendors offer several grades of support to choose&#xD;
        from. The more you pay the better support you get.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Vendor commitment. How committed is the vendor to you as a new customer? If you run into problems with the tool,&#xD;
        what kind of help can they offer? In what time-frame and to what cost?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Influence. What influence will you have on the future of the tool? How will your need be prioritized?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maintenance. How does the vendor handle bugs in the tool? Are there planned &quot;service pack&quot; releases?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training. What training do they offer? What is the availability of training courses?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product future. Is there a plan that describes the future evolvement of the tool?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Licensing. Should you buy one site license for all project members, or should you buy one tool per individual? Some&#xD;
        tools offer &quot;floating&quot; licenses, which sets a limit to the number of concurrent users in an organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this task is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
