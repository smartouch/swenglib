    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide when you what to launch the process and tool improvements&amp;nbsp;to a wider audience of software development&#xD;
    projects. You may want to run one or two pilot projects before you launch to the entire organization. For more&#xD;
    information about alternative implementation approaches, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Decide how to facilitate the launch of process and tools. There are a number of things you can do to facilitate&#xD;
    software development projects in implementing the process and tools, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developing ready-to-use templates and examples that all projects can use.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developing training programs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developing process implementation guidelines that provide guidance to those people who will be responsible for&#xD;
        implementing both the process and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Preparing mentors who will support the projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide whether you are&amp;nbsp;going to develop an organization-wide development environment that each software&#xD;
    development project can use with the necessary adaptations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In most situations, we recommend you wait until several software development projects have used the process and tools&#xD;
    before you take this step. At that point, it will be easier to identify those parts of the process and tools that are&#xD;
    reusable and those that will benefit from being owned, and maintained, by a separate organization.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    If you decide to develop an organization-wide environment, you must initiate a project to develop the organization's&#xD;
    development environment.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    If you decide to initiate a project that develops the organization-wide development environment, it must be made clear&#xD;
    that this project team will work very closely with the software development project teams. It must also be understood&#xD;
    that the team who develops the organization-wide development environment is a service organization measured by the&#xD;
    success of the software development projects it supports.&lt;br />&#xD;

    Adoption cannot be deemed successful without metrics in place to evaluate actual performance. These metrics should&#xD;
    consist of the following attributes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Automated where possible and non-intrusive to work processes&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_zLRNsG25Ed-vK5B6ZgVtPg" name="Plan mentoring" guid="_zLRNsG25Ed-vK5B6ZgVtPg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Experience shows that having a mentor help with implementing a process is a key success factor. Therefore, we recommend&#xD;
    that each software development project has a process mentor to help them start using the process. It is&amp;nbsp;impossible&#xD;
    to give exact figures, but, as a general suggestion, we recommend you plan for at least a 50% full-time equivalence&#xD;
    during the first few of iterations in the project until the project comes up to speed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The projects also need help setting up the tools, so plan to allocate resources for tool mentoring and tools support.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mentoring works best when you have a mentor who reviews results, leads workshops (when needed), and answers questions.&#xD;
    Done well, mentoring can be a very efficient way to transfer knowledge. Ensure that mentors should be experienced&#xD;
    practitioners not purely process-focused.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project needs both the resources and the budget for mentoring on the project. The occurrence of some mentoring&#xD;
    activities need to be planned, such as leading workshops. It's important that the process mentor understands the&#xD;
    significance of being a change driver and makes sure that the work progresses. It's also important that the mentor&#xD;
    becomes dispensable and that there is an end to it, therefore, the mentor needs to transfer both knowledge and&#xD;
    responsibilities to members of the project.&#xD;

    Education is necessary for successful capability improvement adoption. People need to understand the new processes and&#xD;
    how to use the new tools. Study the current competency levels among the organization's people documented in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, look at the parts of the process you plan to implement, and what tools will be introduced in each project.&#xD;
    Identify those areas where the organization's people need to raise their levels of competency and to what extent this&#xD;
    must be done.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Decide what training is needed for each project. A change of process and tools affects the entire organization,&#xD;
    therefore, in addition to mentoring we recommend you train people outside of the projects to give them an understanding&#xD;
    of what the change means.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several ways to educate people to support successful adoption:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Standard training courses to introduce the new process and tools&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Boot-camps&quot; consisting of concentrated, hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford boot-camps. However,&#xD;
        they have proven to be efficient if there are many new elements to learn.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Kick-start&quot; workshops are an efficient way to get the people up-to-speed in a day when introducing a new&#xD;
        improvement. In this type of workshop, people work using their real project material and following the new parts of&#xD;
        the process using the new templates, guidelines, and tools. Typically, a process engineer and a tool specialist&#xD;
        would be responsible for this workshop. Do not spend a lot of time developing training material for a kick-start&#xD;
        workshop. The main purpose is to give hands-on experience with templates, guidelines, and tools. The kick-start&#xD;
        workshop is also a way to verify the process assets and tool configurations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One common mistake in process and tool adoption is failing to communicate expectations clearly to the effected&#xD;
    stakeholders. Depending on your organizational culture, use whatever medium is appropriate to communicate the goals and&#xD;
    expectations to the stakeholders. This might be through briefing sessions, workshops, training sessions, presentations,&#xD;
    team meetings, teleconferences and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The greatest threat to any change in an organization is peoples' attitudes towards the change. The following actions&#xD;
    may help prevent negative attitudes from forming among people in the organization:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Set realistic expectations. Do not oversell the new process or the new tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Involve key people in the change work. Let them be part of the pilot project and give them responsibility for parts&#xD;
        of the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain why the change is needed. What problems does the organization have that need to be solved? What changes in&#xD;
        technology require a new process and new tools?How will you benefit from using these new tools and process?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inform all people in the organization about what is happening. For example, keep all departments informed about&#xD;
        what is going on. This information doesn't have to be in very great detail; the important thing is that they&#xD;
        receive some information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remember stakeholders such as customers or sponsors. For example, if you change from a more waterfall-like&#xD;
        development approach to an iterative development approach, the stakeholders must understand how an iterative&#xD;
        development project is managed and how progress is measured. In an iterative development project, for example, they&#xD;
        cannot expect a completely frozen design at an early milestone. They would also be affected when projects change&#xD;
        the way they capture requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
