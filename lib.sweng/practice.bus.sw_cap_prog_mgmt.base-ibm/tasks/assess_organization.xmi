    To improve software development capabilities&amp;nbsp;it is&amp;nbsp;important to understand problem areas and potential areas&#xD;
    for improvement, as well as information about external issues such as competitors and trends in the market. When this&#xD;
    task is complete, you should understand:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the current state of the software development organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the kinds of people involved and their levels of competence, skills, and motivation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the tools currently used by the organization to support software development&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the current software engineering process and how it is&amp;nbsp;described&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        what improvements are needed in order to meet&amp;nbsp;operational objectives&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A successful assessment requires:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        an identified set of operational objectives against which to measure process performance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        availability of project and&amp;nbsp;team&amp;nbsp;leads, experienced assessors, and domain subject-matter experts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organizational&amp;nbsp;commitment to identify and free-up key staff for the process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        facilitation of honest and accurate communication about the state of current processes and tools usage&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When providing recommendations for improvement, keep in mind that introducing many changes all at once is rarely&#xD;
    successful. Plan&amp;nbsp;a few changes, measuring the results, and then undertaking further change based on those results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For changes to be effective, the people who will need to change their behavior (the actual teams developing&#xD;
    software)&amp;nbsp; must be involved in the entire assessment and recommendations effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be aware of any potentially conflicting initiatives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessments are typically performed once per year to ensure that the organization's processes are aligned with its&#xD;
    business and operational objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Obtain commitment from senior management for the assessment. Their sponsorship is required to&amp;nbsp;provide adequate&#xD;
    funding&amp;nbsp;and to ensure managers and staff participate in the assessment activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Confirm that&amp;nbsp;your organization's operational objectives have been identified as these will drive priorities for&#xD;
    capability improvement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the scope of the assessment based on organizational challenges. Assessments can focus on the entire organization&#xD;
    or on particular business units or teams.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establish the assessment team. Identify suitable and available staff members, including one to fulfill the role of lead&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process &#xD;

            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Implementation (e.g. Java, C++, Relational databases)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tools (e.g. IBM Rational RequisitePro, IBM Rational Team Concert)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Problem domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technology (e.g. distributed systems)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Administrative and organizational skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Organizational knowledge&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each of these competency areas, assess the knowledge, expertise, and experience of the people in the organization.&#xD;
    There are several ways to do this:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ask one or several managers to rank the competencies of individuals or entire teams.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ask the employees themselves to rank their own competencies in each area.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each area, estimate the individual's competency. The following is an example of a simple competency scale that can&#xD;
    be used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Expert&lt;/b>. Can act as mentor to others.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Working knowledg&lt;/b>e. Can work independently.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Basic knowledge&lt;/b>. May occasionally need help.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Novice&lt;/b>. May not be familiar with the subject.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make a competency profiles of individuals and compile competency profiles for entire teams. It is&amp;nbsp;just as&#xD;
    important to understand the competency profile of a team as a whole because no individual alone can have all the&#xD;
    necessary competencies.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Interview people to understand their attitudes toward changing to new technology, new tools, and new process. If people&#xD;
    are negative or skeptical toward the change, it is impossible to succeed with the change unless you turn their negative&#xD;
    attitudes into positive ones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand the process culture of your organization.&amp;nbsp;Are teams used to a prescriptive, high-ceremony approach? Or&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analyze the capacity for change in the organization and among its individuals. When looking at the organization's&#xD;
    problems, there may be&amp;nbsp;a tendency to want to fix everything all at once, especially since many of these problems&#xD;
    occur together. This is a fatal trap. Organizations, just like individuals, can accommodate change only within a&#xD;
    limited range. Different organizations are better prepared for change than others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe the characteristics of projects and applications typical for the organization. Look at both finished projects&#xD;
    and projects currently running. Collect information by interviewing individuals or entire teams. Study the results&#xD;
    produced by projects (e.g. project plans, artifacts produced by the project, process descriptions, project testimonials&#xD;
    and final status assessments).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collect the following characteristics about each project and its product in order to understand the factors and what&#xD;
    effect they will have on how your process descriptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Size of the software development efforts. What is the size of the product?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Degree of novelty. Where, on a scale between &quot;green-field development&quot; and maintenance, is the product?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Type of application. Is the application mission-critical? Are there any requirements to follow specific standards?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify what type of development the organization typically conducts. For example, is it contract work,&#xD;
        speculative development, internal development or pre-studies.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical complexity. What are the technical problems and challenges in building the product? For example, is the&#xD;
        application a distributed system, a safety-critical system or a high-integrity system? Are there any legacy systems&#xD;
        that will be reused?&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Review current descriptions&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Read existing process descriptions to understand the depth of the existing development process. For each discipline or&#xD;
    process area, identify what kinds of description is available for that discipline. For example, find out if there are&#xD;
    no descriptions at all, and whether there are examples, guidelines, document templates, activity descriptions, artifact&#xD;
    descriptions, and so on.&amp;nbsp;Confirm that processes are well integrated.&amp;nbsp;Identify integration points between&#xD;
    processes (e.g. what input and output work products are shared between processes).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remember that different teams may be using different processes for the same capability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Compare to process standards&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider&amp;nbsp;any process definition&amp;nbsp;requirements as you perform your assessment. Is your industry highly&#xD;
    regulated, requiring a heavy evidence-based process? Are you trying to achieve a CMMI maturity level that requires&#xD;
    proof of performing each process requirement?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful to compare your process against some standard such as the IBM Rational Unified Process, or to an&#xD;
    improvement approach such as CMMI for Development. This can help you identify any gaps or areas of insufficient&#xD;
    coverage. However, do not implement process improvements just to cover gaps. Confirm there is an organizational need&#xD;
    (the process will help you achieve some operational objective).&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Assess consistency&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Confirm whether processes are applied consistently.&amp;nbsp; Are the process descriptions sufficiently described to be&#xD;
    repeatable across projects? Do tailoring guidelines exist&amp;nbsp;so that individual project teams know how to apply the&#xD;
    process in their context?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Conduct interviews&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make sure to interview your key people&amp;nbsp;and stakeholders as you evaluate process descriptions. Insight from those&#xD;
    actually using the process and&amp;nbsp;who understand what problems need to be addressed is critical to the assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With a good understanding of the existing process, you will:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        understand what type of process description teams are used to.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessment workshops are also helpful for identifying improvement opportunities.&amp;nbsp;See &lt;a&#xD;

    Analyze the results of the collected information and compile a list of areas and issues on which to focus. Issues that&#xD;
    should be addressed early usually fall into one or several of the following categories:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        major problem areas where you can significantly improve the performance of the projects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        areas where you can make short-term profits and where you can quickly show results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        areas where an improvement will have high visibility&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make sure to also compile a list of what is working well for the organization in terms of processes and tools usage as&#xD;
    well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Validate findings with stakeholders to achieve consensus.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Recommendations for the future are&amp;nbsp;developed as part of the assessment. Each recommendation should be prioritized&#xD;
    and&amp;nbsp;describe how the development organization should go forward to implement process and tool improvements. The&#xD;
    recommendations could consist of actionable road maps,&amp;nbsp;outlined implementation plans, project plans, tailoring&#xD;
    suggestions, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make recommendations based on the strengths and weaknesses identified in the assessment, defining clear goals of what&#xD;
    to improve.&amp;nbsp;Ensure that the roadmap for implementation is aligned with the organization's operational objectives.&#xD;
    Always pay attention to the reasons why the organization should adopt a new process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Agree on measures for success/improvement from process and tool adoption:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select from a common set of measures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In addition to objective measures, some &quot;subjective measures&quot; can also be identified&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focus&amp;nbsp;on key success factors, ideally defined as part of an analysis of Return-On-Investment (ROI).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine your recommendations based on a recent assessment. Do not wait for months after an assessment to prepare&#xD;
    improvement road maps as the capability snapshot taken at that moment in time may no longer apply.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Present recommendations to stakeholders and key people to achieve consensus and confirm support.&amp;nbsp; An understanding&#xD;
    of the deployment vision and the steps required to implement this vision is critical. This vision must be shared and&#xD;
    internalized by all stakeholders.&#xD;

    Assess the organization's software processes and tools usage in order to make recommendations for improvement against&#xD;
    operational objectives. This task is performed so that you can:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        understand your current state and drivers for improvements. Establish a baseline for the planned ongoing measures&#xD;
        of success and operational performance.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        identify those areas that need to be improved first, starting with the areas that have the greatest need and the&#xD;
        best potential for improvement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        explain to sponsors why you need to change the process, tools, and people.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        create motivation and a common understanding among the people in the organization regarding who will be directly&#xD;
        and indirectly affected by the changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        create a roadmap of capability improvements that aligns with your organization's business objectives.&lt;br />&#xD;
