  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process and tools&amp;nbsp;improvement program should be managed as you manage any other program of&#xD;
    projects.&amp;nbsp;Implementing new processes and tools&amp;nbsp;across an organization&amp;nbsp;is a complex&amp;nbsp;effort requiring&#xD;
    effective planning, monitoring, and control, because changing the way people work can jeopardize the success of&#xD;
    projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Set up milestones, allocate resources, execute iteratively, and manage it as you would a software development project.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To&amp;nbsp;identify risks, consider 'what can go wrong.' At the broadest level, of course, everything can go wrong. The&#xD;
    point is not to cast a pessimistic view on the program, however; we want to identify potential barriers to success so&#xD;
    that we can reduce or eliminate them. More specifically, we are looking for the events which might occur which would&#xD;
    decrease the likelihood that we will be able to deliver process and tools improvements with the right features, the&#xD;
    requisite level of quality, on time and within budget.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Generally, based on the existing list, new risks will be identified by the team members, and captured at regular Status&#xD;
    Assessments.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Accommodate approved work for each process improvement project. This includes the development of plans,&#xD;
    developing&amp;nbsp;or evolving&amp;nbsp;process assets and tool configurations, conducting training and mentoring and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each project:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Iteration Plan prepared at the start of the iteration can select only from what is known at the time. This will be&#xD;
    an increment of the total capability required (the requirements), and Change Requests left over from previous&#xD;
    iterations. The Process Manager can then determine the resources and schedule for the iteration. Allowance for&#xD;
    addressing problems and issues should be built into the plan for the iteration, either implicitly, in the effort&#xD;
    allocated to the production of an artifact, or explicitly, in particular work packages. It is recommended that the&#xD;
    latter method be adopted.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The Process Manager will exercise some planning discretion in deciding when work should be undertaken - but in general,&#xD;
    an attempt should be made to correct problems in the iteration in which they are discovered, and it should be possible&#xD;
    to do this with the resources planned at the start of the iteration. There will inevitably be some (discovered) issues&#xD;
    left unfixed at the end of an iteration (because an iteration should be timeboxed), but for the iteration to be deemed&#xD;
    a success, it is not likely that many of these would be severe or rated high priority for other reasons.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Little allowance can be made, however, for other than trivial enhancement requests, that arise unexpectedly. If such a&#xD;
    Change Request for a substantial enhancement is sanctioned for the current iteration, the Process Manager will almost&#xD;
    certainly have to re-plan, either by pushing off some planned capability to the next iteration, or by finding extra&#xD;
    resources to make the change. Usually, such requests for enhancements will be held over for the next iteration, or even&#xD;
    later ones, and then be made part of the regular iteration planning cycle.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capture current status of the program, evaluate it against plans, and report it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, project leads submit regular progress reports to the&amp;nbsp;Process Manager providing the following&#xD;
    information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effort booked against work packages&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimated effort to complete each work package for which they are responsible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tasks completed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deliverables published&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issues arising that require management attention (from Review Records, for example). The Process Manager may record&#xD;
        some or all of these in the Issues List for further attention and tracking.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In order to properly assess the program's progress in relation to the plans, the&amp;nbsp;Process Manager &quot;rolls-up&quot; the&#xD;
    primitive metrics reported by the project teams to provide a full picture of the program's progress. The program's&#xD;
    Measurement Plan describes how these derived metrics (the &quot;progress indicators&quot;) are calculated.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In addition to monitoring the work progress, the&amp;nbsp;Process Manager also monitors the quality of the project&#xD;
    artifacts. Quality metrics (again as defined by the program's Measurement Plan), are consolidated to provide an overall&#xD;
    picture of the program's status compared to its stated quality objectives&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Having derived the program's progress and quality indicators, the Process Manager compares these against the expected&#xD;
    state of the program as defined by the Release and Iteration Plans. At this point the&amp;nbsp;Process Manager will&#xD;
    evaluate the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have all planned tasks been completed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have all artifacts been published as planned?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is the estimated effort to complete tasks that are &quot;in progress&quot; within plan?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are quality metrics (e.g. open defect counts) within planned tolerances?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;Process Manager will also review the risk indicators identified for each risk on the Risk List to decide&#xD;
    whether any risk mitigation strategies should be activated at this time.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Relevant details are published to stakeholders as appropriate.&lt;br />&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_OwYt0GrAEd-gOYgCf-l1EQ" name="Handle exceptions and problems" guid="_OwYt0GrAEd-gOYgCf-l1EQ">
    <sectionDescription>Initiate appropriate corrective actions to problems and exceptions arising in the program.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;Process Manager invokes the Handle Exceptions and Problems step to address any problems or issues as they&#xD;
    become known.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The first task is to evaluate each of the problems/issues identified in the Status Assessment and Issues List of all&#xD;
    projects within the program. Most projects run a regular (often weekly) &quot;Issues Meeting&quot; for this purpose attended by&#xD;
    the project manager, technical lead, and other team leads. For each problem/issue you need to identify the cause, its&#xD;
    impact on the project and the program, and determine what your options are to resolve it. You should also determine if&#xD;
    the possible solutions are within the authority of the project team to implement.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Next, for each problem/exception, select the preferred approach for resolution and determine the steps you need to take&#xD;
    to implement it. Once the corrective action for each problem or exception has been determined, and any necessary&#xD;
    approvals, the project manager documents the work involved and raises Change Requests and/or Work Orders to initiate&#xD;
    the work. The project manager is often able to retire issues from the Issues List at this point, because the closure&#xD;
    will be tracked by other means.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_dI1aEGrAEd-gOYgCf-l1EQ" name="Prepare for project close-out (for each project)" guid="_dI1aEGrAEd-gOYgCf-l1EQ">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Complete the formalities associated with project acceptance and close-out, reassign project staff, and transfer other&#xD;
    project resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step occurs for each&amp;nbsp;capability improvement project&amp;nbsp;after the final delivery of the main deliverables.&#xD;
    The expectation is that there remain no problems that will preclude formal acceptance and adoption, and that any issues&#xD;
    that do remain are documented and handed over for resolution to the maintenance team. A final Status Assessment will be&#xD;
    prepared for the Project Acceptance Review; the stakeholders should acknowledge that all deliverables have been&#xD;
    completed according to the contract and its supporting plans. If&amp;nbsp; acceptance is not provided, then there may have&#xD;
    to be another iteration to resolve the issues that block acceptance.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The project manager handles the remaining administrative tasks of project termination. These&amp;nbsp;may include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensuring that the project is formally accepted: the contract and the Product Acceptance Plan will describe the&#xD;
        requirements. In the end, what is needed, in effect, is signed agreement from the customer that all contracted&#xD;
        deliveries have been made, meet the contracted requirements and are accepted into ownership by the customer; all&#xD;
        contracted activities (including acceptance test, if any) have been successfully completed; and that the customer&#xD;
        takes all further responsibility (warranty and latent defect claims aside), for the products and any residual&#xD;
        issues and actions associated with them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Settling the project's finances - making sure all payments have been received and all suppliers and subcontractors&#xD;
        paid. Organizational policy or other regulatory requirement may also require a more formal audit process at project&#xD;
        termination, covering the project's finances, budgeting process, and assets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Archiving all project documentation and records.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transferring any remaining (non-deliverable) hardware and environment assets to the owning organization's pool of&#xD;
        assets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transfer the project measurements to the corporate historical database.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reassign remaining project staff: if possible, this should not be done abruptly. Most projects can accommodate a&#xD;
        gradual ramp-down of staff levels, and allow a smoother transition of staff to other projects. The project manager&#xD;
        should ensure that the project knowledge and responsibilities of departing staff have been transferred to those&#xD;
        remaining. Staff performance reviews should also be conducted as staff are transferred.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is performed iteratively and as&amp;nbsp;often as required. It is typically required for any nontrivial&#xD;
    capability enhancement efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the organization does not manage capability improvement as&amp;nbsp;a program,&amp;nbsp;process and tools adoption is at&#xD;
    risk. Without a managed program it is difficult to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provide objective evidence that the organization is improving&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Achieve successful adoption by managing risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is critical that the organizational software capability improvement team sees themselves as a service organization&#xD;
    measured by the success of the software development projects it supports.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
