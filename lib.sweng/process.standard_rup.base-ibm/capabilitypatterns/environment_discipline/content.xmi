    For each iteration, this activity&amp;nbsp;is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completing the process definition to get ready for the iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Preparing and, if necessary, customizing the&amp;nbsp;tools to be used within the iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Verifying that the tools have been correctly configured and installed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Preparing a set of project-specific templates and guidelines to support the development of project artifacts in the&#xD;
        iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure that all the changes made to the project environment are properly communicated to the project members.&#xD;

    This activity is recommended for any project, although the described tasks may be performed somewhat informally in some&#xD;
    types of projects and may be considered part of the on-going support of the project environment. For more information&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>As the name implies, this activity&amp;nbsp;is performed at the beginning of every iteration.</usageGuidance>
    <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to ensure that the project environment is ready for the upcoming iteration. This includes&#xD;
process and tools.</purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Process Engineer is responsible for defining the process. It's unusual that one individual can master all&#xD;
    disciplines of software development, therefore, it's important that the process engineer consults experts, both within&#xD;
    and outside of the development organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development of project-specific templates and guidelines can be done by several people. There is no need for&#xD;
    detailed knowledge of the process to develop these project-specific artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are normally several individuals who act as Tool Specialists. Each individual is then responsible for one tool or&#xD;
    a group of related tools.&#xD;

    Preparing the development environment involves:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defining how the project is going to use the configured development process.&#xD;

        Qualifying work product selections with timing and formality requirements.&#xD;

        Preparing project-specific assets, like guidelines and templates.&#xD;

    It is recommended to always spend some time preparing your development environment based on the specific needs of the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Preparing the environment for the project is done during the Inception phase. Any subsequent work done to improve and&#xD;
    complete the prepared environment is described in the activity: Prepare Environment for an Iteration.&#xD;

    <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to turn the underlying development process into a Project Defined Process, and to make&#xD;

    The tasks in this activity are best carried out by a small team, staffed by individuals with a good general knowledge&#xD;
    of the development process. If the organization has a dedicated process group focusing on process and development&#xD;
    environment, the&amp;nbsp;method developer&amp;nbsp;role is often staffed from this group.&#xD;

    Supporting the project environment is an ongoing task to allow the project members to do their job efficiently without&#xD;
    being slowed down due to issues with the development environment. This includes installation of required software,&#xD;
    ensuring that the hardware is functioning properly and that potential network issues are resolved without delays.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project environment needs continuous attention. This means that tasks related to supporting the environment are&#xD;
    performed in every iteration throughout the project, with a peak in late elaboration and early construction, when the&#xD;
    whole project machinery is up and running.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is required in most project settings.&#xD;

    <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to support the developers in their use of tools and process during an iteration.</purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support of the environment is carried out by one person or a small team of several people. In large organizations,&#xD;
    these people are often part of the company's IT department or members of its process group.&#xD;

    Decide How to Perform the Workflow&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following decisions should be made regarding the Environment discipline's workflow:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the activities in this workflow. Study the diagram with its guard&#xD;
        conditions and the guidelines. Decide which activities to perform and in which order.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide what parts of the Environment activities to perform. In general, the artifacts in the Environment discipline&#xD;
        are introduced as they are needed. For example, a&amp;nbsp;manual styleguide is developed only if the project will&#xD;
        develop user support material.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide when, during the project lifecycle, to introduce each part of the workflow. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/project_defined_process_8BF5845B.html&quot;&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many software-development tools support teams of people, with several users working with information stored in a shared&#xD;
    repository. Each user uses the tool on their personal computer (client) and the shared repository is stored on a&#xD;
    central server.&amp;nbsp;In this case the tool must be installed on the server and on the clients. Customizing the tool is&#xD;
    done both on the server and on the client.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are tools that do not use a shared repository, such as compilers, debuggers, editors, graphic tools, etc. These&#xD;
    tools can simply be installed on the users' computers. It may still be needed to customize the tools so that all&#xD;
    members of the project use the tool in the same way.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The approach should be to automate as much as possible of the installation and customization procedures.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>The tools and the development infrastructure has to be verified before the project starts using them. How this is done will&#xD;
clearly vary dependent upon skills, technology, and tools.</refinedDescription>
