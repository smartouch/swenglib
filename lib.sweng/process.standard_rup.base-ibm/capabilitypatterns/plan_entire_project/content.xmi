  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This pattern, or&amp;nbsp;set of activities,&amp;nbsp;groups all of the general planning for a release together into one&#xD;
    pattern.&amp;nbsp; Since the individual planning activities&amp;nbsp;are not of particular interest by themselves, including&#xD;
    this high-level pattern in iteration plans emphasizes the goal to be achieved,&amp;nbsp;but leaves the details of the&#xD;
    activities it takes to do&amp;nbsp;accomplish the goal&amp;nbsp;to the next level of detail. This allows an activity diagram,&#xD;
    such as an iteration workflow, to&amp;nbsp;show these activities going on, without excessively cluttering up the diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By using this pattern in the Templates for Delivery Processes (the capability patterns designed to describe the&#xD;
    activities in a particular iteration) the details of these planning activities can be suppressed in an Activity Diagram&#xD;
    (or workflow diagram) for an iteration, since what is of interest is the planning for all aspects of the project, not&#xD;
    the individual plan areas.&#xD;
