&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        all major issues from the previous iteration are resolved&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity occurs in every iteration of every phase. Issues can come up at any time. The timing of other activities&#xD;
    is tailored to suit the project. For example, the project manager could decide to produce weekly metrics reports, and&#xD;
    report to the PRA monthly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager should put in place mechanisms to automate, as far as possible, the collection and reduction of&#xD;
    information (metrics, for example) about the project. Time should be spent in analyzing trends, not in collection and&#xD;
    calculation. The responsibility for solution of problems that arise on a project obviously ultimately rests with the&#xD;
    Project Manager. However, there is a class of technical problems that should be delegated to the Software Architect,&#xD;
    for example, for solution. The Project Manager's role is then to implement the suggested solution - which may give rise&#xD;
    to a secondary problem, say, lack of resources, which does have to be solved by the Project Manager. This demonstrates&#xD;
    the kind of trust that must exist between the Project Manager and the technical staff - the Project Manager expects the&#xD;
    Software Architect to devise sound technical solutions, and the Software Architect expects the Project Manager to put&#xD;
    in place the infrastructure and resources to implement them, contractual and financial constraints permitting.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>This activity&amp;nbsp;acquires the necessary resources to perform the iteration, allocates the work to be done, and finally,&#xD;
to assess the results of the iteration. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, in a lengthy iteration, the Project Manager may think it prudent to resynchronize the expectations of&#xD;
    management, technical staff, customer and other stakeholders, by holding a review to evaluate the iteration&#xD;
    criteria&amp;nbsp;mid-way through the iteration. At this review, which is based mainly around the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/guidelines/test_plan_1370782C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_f9OBoHHWEdyzS55ez-koKA&quot;>Test Plan&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;the project reveals the planned contents of the iteration in a very&#xD;
    concrete way. This gives an opportunity for a 'mid-course correction', should misunderstandings have arisen over the&#xD;
    intent of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A mix of skills is needed for the activities in this activity: although the Project Manager may rely on a human&#xD;
    resources function to provide candidate project members, in the end the responsibility for selection is his or hers.&#xD;
    Interviewing skills are valuable, as is a history of selecting good people. The Project Manager will need to show&#xD;
    planning, leadership and team building capabilities to initiate the iteration - to allocate the work appropriately, and&#xD;
    realize the abstract Iteration Plan in effective teams of people.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria for an iteration should have been set objectively and clearly, so the assessment of an&#xD;
    iteration requires the Project Manager to be analytic and equally objective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Management Reviewer for these reviews needs to be very experienced in the domain of the application, and able to&#xD;
    sift out what is important and what can be ignored or relaxed. While none should be in any doubt about what worked and&#xD;
    what failed in the iteration, all requirements are not of equal importance, nor are they immutable. Knowledge is gained&#xD;
    over the course of an iteration and circumstances may change. For example, at the beginning of the iteration, one of&#xD;
    the evaluation criteria might have said that the response time for a certain function had to be 0.25 seconds or less.&#xD;
    Let us say that this proved very difficult, and by the time of the Iteration Acceptance Review, the project could only&#xD;
    demonstrate 0.5 seconds. It is thought that the lower figure can be achieved, but only with the expenditure of&#xD;
    excessive resources. However, the customer, having seen the function demonstrated in an operational context, finds that&#xD;
    0.5 seconds is perfectly acceptable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failing the iteration on this count alone would not be sensible. Far better for the Project Manager and Management&#xD;
    Reviewer to agree to relax this requirement, and as compensation, to add capability elsewhere. The Management Reviewer&#xD;
    (and Project Manager) need the experience and confidence to make these kinds of trades, which do not compromise the&#xD;
    project vision.&#xD;

    The Iteration Plan should be reviewed by the customer and other stakeholders and, if satisfactory, should be approved&#xD;
    through the iteration plan review. This review also gives the customer visibility of the project's expectations of&#xD;
    customer participation and resources, particularly if the iteration is intended to deliver artifacts or deploy&#xD;
    software, so the customer can make appropriate plans. In the Rational Unified Process, it is strongly recommended that&#xD;
    the scope and resources of an iteration are actively managed to meet the planned end date, that is, a timeboxing&#xD;
    approach is used. This means that the Iteration Plan may be changed during an iteration, as schedule problems arise and&#xD;
    are rectified.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager should work closely with the Software Architect to define the iteration's contents. The Iteration&#xD;

    <purpose>The primary purpose of this activity is to create an Iteration Plan. After creating the plan, adjustments may be needed to&#xD;

    The Project Manager needs a combination of planning, risk management and estimation skills, and an appreciation for the&#xD;
    technical content of the iteration, because the iteration's contents will be decided based on considerations of risk,&#xD;
    the need to demonstrate or deliver certain artifacts and capability, and the natural order imposed by integration. The&#xD;
    Project Manager will work closely with the architect in the preparation of the Iteration Plan. The Management Reviewer&#xD;
    should have similar skills to the Project Manager, and also needs good domain understanding.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Iteration Plan should be reviewed by the customer and other stakeholders and, if satisfactory, should be approved&#xD;
    through the Iteration Plan Review. This review also gives the customer visibility of the project's expectations of&#xD;
    customer participation and resources-particularly if the iteration is intended to deliver artifacts or deploy&#xD;
    software-so the customer can make appropriate plans. In the Rational Unified Process, it is strongly recommended that&#xD;
    the scope and resources of an iteration are actively managed to meet the planned end date, that is, a timeboxing&#xD;
    approach is used. This means that the Iteration Plan may be changed during an iteration, as schedule problems arise and&#xD;
    are rectified.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager should work closely with the Software Architect to define the iteration's contents. The Iteration&#xD;

    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager needs a combination of planning, risk management and estimation skills, and an appreciation for the&#xD;
    technical content of the iteration, because the iteration's contents will be decided based on considerations of risk,&#xD;
    the need to demonstrate or deliver certain artifacts and capability, and the natural order imposed by integration. The&#xD;
    Project Manager will work closely with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the conclusion of Plan Project, enough should be known about the risks and possible business returns of the project,&#xD;
    to allow an informed decision to be made to commit funds for the rest of the Inception Phase, or to abandon the&#xD;
    project. Next, the initial Iteration Plan is refined to control the remainder of the initial iteration in inception, in&#xD;
    an invocation of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../process.standard_rup.base-ibm/capabilitypatterns/plan_for_next_iteration_B77961A7.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_hh3U-SYtEd-Oda441NMnHQ&quot;>Activity: Plan for Next Iteration&lt;/a> (the activity used here is the same as will be&#xD;
    used for planning subsequent iterations - hence the somewhat odd name in this context). In Plan for Next Iteration, the&#xD;

    decide which requirements are to be explored, refined or realized. In early iterations, the emphasis is on the&#xD;
    discovery and refinement of requirements; in later iterations, on the construction of software to realize those&#xD;
    requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this point, the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    review, to determine if the objectives for the iteration have been achieved. The&amp;nbsp;iteration acceptance review may&#xD;
    determine that the project should be terminated, if the iteration has significantly missed its objectives, and it is&#xD;
    judged that the project cannot recover during subsequent iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, at about the mid-point of the iteration,&amp;nbsp;an iteration evaluation criteria review may be held, to&#xD;
    review the iteration &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/workproducts/test_plan_7503019A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_yiMRwHFfEdy8Ac588DXPCQ&quot;>Test Plan&lt;/a>, which by this stage should be well-defined. This optional review is&#xD;
    usually held only for lengthy (six months and longer) iterations. It gives project management and other stakeholders&#xD;
    the opportunity to make mid-course corrections.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In parallel with Manage Iteration, the routine daily, weekly and monthly tasks of the project management are performed&#xD;
    in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        System-wide requirements
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>

        Defects
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Development tasks
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). Once work items have been&#xD;
    assigned to the iteration, the team ensures that they can complete all work, regardless of original work item&#xD;
    priorities. Deciding what to develop first on an iteration will vary across projects and iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes and enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). Once work items have been&#xD;
    assigned to the iteration, the team ensures that they can complete all work, regardless of original work item&#xD;
    priorities. Deciding what to develop first on an iteration will vary across projects and iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references those&#xD;
    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;
    results and actions from assessments.&#xD;
