    The Business Use Case Model is used by stakeholders and&amp;nbsp;business analysts to understand and improve the way the&#xD;
    business interacts with its environment, and by systems analysts and software architects to provide context for&#xD;
    software development. The project manager uses this artifact to plan the content of iterations during business modeling&#xD;
    and track progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to re-engineer the target organization, consider maintaining two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Use-Case Model: one that shows the business actors and business use cases of the current&#xD;
    organization (sometimes called &quot;as-is&quot;), and one that shows the target organization with new business actors and&#xD;
    business use cases (&quot;to-be&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are considering a significant redesign of the way the target organization works (business re-engineering), this&#xD;
    separation is needed otherwise the redesign will be developed without knowing&amp;nbsp; what the proposed changes really&#xD;
    are at the end, and you will not be able to estimate the effects or costs of those changes. It is like an architect who&#xD;
    is asked to draw up plans for changing a townhouse into three flats, without having an as-is blueprint from which to&#xD;
    work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of maintaining two Business Use-Case Models is not insignificant, and carefully consider how much effort you&#xD;
    put into a current model. Typically, you would not do more than identify and briefly describe the business use cases*&#xD;
    and business actors. You would also briefly outline the business use cases you determine are key to the effort,&#xD;
    possibly illustrating this with a simple activity diagram. The level of detail you choose aims at providing a shared&#xD;
    understanding of the target organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You would not need this separation in the following situations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no &quot;new&quot; organization (the goal is to document an existing organization)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no existing organization* (business creation)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business actors in the use-case model are used by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>business analysts&lt;/b>, to define the boundaries of the organization and describe the interactions between actors&#xD;
        and business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>user-interface designers&lt;/b>, as input to capturing characteristics on human actors in the a system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>system analysts&lt;/b>, as input to finding system actors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>*Note: when modeling an existing organization to create an as-is model, you need to do little more than create the&#xD;
    brief descriptions of business use cases, business actors and key business events and associate these with the existing&#xD;
    business goals because you can move more directly to capturing actual current business processes that realize these&#xD;
    business use cases. The current business use cases serve as anchors to explain the purpose of the current business&#xD;
    processes. When the purpose is business creation, the new business use cases are &lt;strong>specifications&lt;/strong> for&#xD;
    achievement of the business goals, for a business that does not yet exist. Consequently, they will need much more&#xD;

    A Business Use Case is an account of a pattern of use&amp;nbsp;in a business, and the effect that use has on the&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Use Cases are useful for any organization that wants to know what value the business provides and how it&#xD;

    processes and to understand the effect of any proposed changes (for example, a merger or a first CRM implementation) on&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact concretely&amp;nbsp;defines the services offered by the business in terms of interfaces and operations, the&#xD;
    information that is passed around (business entities), the internal business structures (that is,&amp;nbsp;organization and&#xD;
    business workers), and how they collaborate to realize the external behavior described in the business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the place where all the design decisions are captured.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;more abstract&quot; elements from the Business&#xD;
    Analysis Model evolve into &quot;more concrete&quot; elements that take into account constraints an details like the business&#xD;
    environment, organizational capabilities, etc.&amp;nbsp; For example, the initial Business Workers are mapped or realized&#xD;
    into human workers or automated systems and services.&amp;nbsp; In most of the cases the Business Analysis Model evolves&#xD;
    into a Business Design Model as more concrete decisions are made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This Business Model is used by stakeholders and business analysts to understand how the&amp;nbsp;business currently works&#xD;
    (in as-is form), and to analyze the effect of changes to the business(in to-be form).&amp;nbsp; The business analyst is&#xD;
    responsible for the structure and integrity of the model along with detailing the elements within the model.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    model is also used by systems analysts for deriving system&amp;nbsp;requirements based on how automated systems - usually&#xD;
    software-intensive automated business workers - will be used as part of the business process.&amp;nbsp; Software architects&#xD;
    use the model to define a software architecture that fits the organization seamlessly and to identify classes in&#xD;
    software analysis and design models.&#xD;

    Create representations (operations and ordering) of the behavior the business needs to perform in order to fulfill&#xD;
    specific scenarios described in the business use cases. This is represented by business elements such as business&#xD;
    components or areas, services, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;__uNa8FoGEd6Gvq_dRUXeQw&quot;>entities&lt;/a>, etc. These white-box or internal descriptions of the business are&#xD;
    organized as use-case realizations; each use case has a corresponding realization where all the white-box descriptions&#xD;
    of the scenarios are maintained. This makes it easier to organize and understand how the business must operate in order&#xD;
    to fulfill the behavior described in the business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of this task is a set of business descriptions that can be used for business re-engineering and the&#xD;
    identification of system services for automation.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Only detail the use-case scenarios that are scheduled for system development or business refactoring in the near term&#xD;
    (in the next iteration or two). This&amp;nbsp;helps avoid unnecessary rework.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not all use-case scenarios require detailing. Focus on those that are unclear, critical, high risk, or are required to&#xD;
    fully communicate the scenario to the skill level of the consumer of the use case.&#xD;
