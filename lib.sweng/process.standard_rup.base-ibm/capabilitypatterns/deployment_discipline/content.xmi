    A beta test gives the product a controlled, real-world test, so that feedback from potential users can be used to shape&#xD;
    the final product.&amp;nbsp; It also provides a preview of the next release to interested customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is most appropriate in situations where the product being built is unprecedented or where the product will be&#xD;
    shrink-wrapped and made available for sale commercially.&#xD;

    This work is generally performed in the construction and transition phases, although there may be situations where it&#xD;
    is useful to perform it as early as the elaboration phase. It is typical for beta testing to be the primary focus for&#xD;
    iterations in which it is conducted,&amp;nbsp; As such this activity will typically be preceded by integration and build&#xD;
    activities focused on enabling the beta test work. This activity itself will typically begin part-way into the&#xD;

    Deployment planning requires a high degree of customer collaboration and preparation. A successful conclusion to a&#xD;
    software project can be severely impacted by factors &lt;i>outside the scope of software development&lt;/i> such as the&#xD;
    building, hardware infrastructure not being in place, and the staff being ill-prepared for changing to the new system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure successful deployment and transition to the new system and ways of doing business, the Deployment Plan needs&#xD;
    to address not only the deliverable software, but also the development of training material and system support material&#xD;
    to ensure that end users can successfully use the delivered software product.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is performed early in each iteration, generally starting late in the construction phase and continuing&#xD;
    through transition. It can begin as soon as iteration planning is reasonably complete for the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    This task is recommended whenever an executable release will be externally deployed outside the primary development&#xD;
    team, either for the purposes of delivering the software to the end user, or for testing purposes.&#xD;

    To explain the work involved in the Deployment discipline, the activities and work products are organized into a&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment is about making the software product available to the end-user and is the culmination of the software&#xD;
    development effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment planning (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_KjZZ0CZIEd-Hb5ChSoDHIA&quot;>Activity: Plan Deployment&lt;/a>) starts early in the project lifecycle and addresses not&#xD;
    only the production of the deliverable software, but also the development of training material and system support&#xD;
    material to ensure that the end-user can successfully use the delivered software product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support material (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    will be required by the end-user to install, operate, use and maintain the delivered system. It also includes training&#xD;
    material for all the various positions that will be required to effectively use the new system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Discipline places a great emphasis on ensuring the product is well tested prior to its release to the&#xD;
    customer base. The&amp;nbsp;activity Manage Acceptance Test&amp;nbsp;covers to two kinds of test environments. Firstly, the&#xD;
    build needs to be sufficiently tested in the development test environment (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../process.standard_rup.base-ibm/capabilitypatterns/manage_acceptance_test_EF097EB8.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_KjZaOiZIEd-Hb5ChSoDHIA&quot;>Activity: Manage Acceptance Test&lt;/a>), and then re-tested at the target site (&lt;a&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_KjZZ9iZIEd-Hb5ChSoDHIA&quot;>Activity: Custom Install&lt;/a>). The 'test environment' should be an 'instance' of the&#xD;
    target environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the product has been tested at the development site it needs to be prepared for delivery to the customer. The&#xD;
    release can created for the purposes of beta-testing, a test deployment to the final users, or depending on it level of&#xD;
    maturity for the final product. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    release that consists of the software, and the necessary accompanying work products required to effectively install and&#xD;
    use it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A beta-program refers to the process used by an organization to solicit feedback from a subset of users on products&#xD;
    that are under development. The feedback is used to augment the product. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;

    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. Appoint one person to be&#xD;
    responsible for all the activities concerning the planning of the rollout:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant education and training a high priority, and get the best people on board.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the plan well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they have time to&#xD;
            digest all the information.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the education and training plan is changed in the middle of rolling out the classes, consider using available&#xD;
    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team&#xD;
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the&#xD;
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the&#xD;
    same as they will use after going live).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If education and training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what&#xD;
    is the best way of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it&#xD;
    takes longer than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The planned lengths of the time for the training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business benefits of the initiative can only be realized if the user community is educated in the new systems and&#xD;
    processes and adopts the desired behaviors. Therefore the objectives of the education and training program are to&#xD;
    provide the users with the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        sufficient skills and knowledge to operate effectively in the new environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            support and encouragement to adopt the required behaviors and attitudes&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            well targeted and delivered education and training courses.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance&#xD;
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it&#xD;
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.&#xD;
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.&#xD;

            Have a chance to find the right people who are analytical and have the necessary skills and abilities to&#xD;
            develop or present training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the system or package well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they&#xD;
            have time to digest all the information&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check what the client's previous experience has been in training situations. Learn about the organization's culture and&#xD;
    previous reactions, and what works and what does not work in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development work must be carefully coordinated with the implementation of the Change Program. Changes in the&#xD;
    implementation should be reflected in the training material, and strict change request procedures must be put in place&#xD;
    to ensure coordination.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key risks should be presented to the client before the specification of the education material is completed. Risk&#xD;
    areas could include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Tools: Will the participants have the right tools on their desk when they have finished the training? Will&#xD;
            testing be successfully completed? Participants can quickly become disillusioned if they perceive problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Material: Has the material been targeted at the correct level? Are learning skills sufficient?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Time scales: Are the schedules realistic ? Has time been allowed for translating the material into other&#xD;
            languages ?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the training material is changed as a result of a change in the Change Program, in the middle of rolling out the&#xD;
    classes, consider using available communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and&#xD;
    where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what is the best way&#xD;
    of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it takes longer&#xD;
    than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.The planned lengths of the&#xD;
    time for training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Education and Training Strategy consists of the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial list of critical success factors for training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of the training needs for staff and the needs identified in other domains&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of alternate methods for delivering the training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An approach for the development of the staff training material&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial roll-out plan for the delivery of education and training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy should address the following three major areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organization: staff must understand and accept new roles, responsibilities and competencies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process: staff must understand the business practices and operating principles associated with the business&#xD;
        processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT: staff must understand and be able to use any new package or system efficiently and effectively to perform their&#xD;
        work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify all staff affected by the change, training requirements for each, sequence of training, delivery methods, and&#xD;
    standards for success. The initial rollout plan should include the training of instructors, pilot classes and&#xD;
    logistical considerations.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interface Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications define the boundaries between the different units of user documentation, as well as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Content&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>The End User Training Materials are the materials used by students and instructors on a course or training session.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
They contain the following, for each of the training modules: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Foils, hand-outs, instructor guides, or just relevant instructor notes.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations xsi:nil="true"/>
    <refinedDescription>Identify areas requiring user assistance. User support material is mainly task oriented, but is often supplemented by&#xD;
conceptual and reference information. Start with the detailed task descriptions and work flows. &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Using writing style standards and guidelines, develop the text, one topic at a time, documenting the step-by-step&#xD;
        details for each task. As required, supplement task-oriented information with conceptual or reference information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop realistic examples based on the user-task scenarios.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Incorporate well-designed graphic illustrations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop a comprehensive index to enable efficient information retrieval.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop a glossary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop appendices&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop preface, introduction, and other required front matter (such as copyright and cross-reference information).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sequence draft, adding transitions between topics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>To develop online help information, perform the same steps as above, except for adding transitions between topics.&#xD;
Also: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create links for hypertext.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create retrieval and navigational aids.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>For a users reference, focus on descriptive information. Develop concise descriptions of each topic, and sequence the&#xD;
topics to optimize the user's ability to retrieve information. For example, a command reference is probably best arranged&#xD;
alphabetically, while a message manual is usually sequenced by message number.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The user's guide and user's reference can be hardcopy, softcopy, or both. Consider that the optimal level of detail and&#xD;
formatting are different for the printed page and the screen. If both hardcopy and softcopy versions are required, the&#xD;
level of detail and formatting should be optimized for screen presentation.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Edit the user documentation drafts, and incorporate editorial changes. Develop user documentation iteratively,&#xD;
incorporating the results of walkthroughs and usability testing.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Determine what functional and technical information must be included in the on-line tutorial and determine the format of&#xD;
the tutorial. Perform the following steps: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the depth of the tutorial. Does the tutorial teach usage or concepts behind product functionality? Will&#xD;
        the tutorial be interactive or non-interactive?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specify the format and the development tool used to generate the tutorial. For example, will the tutorial be an&#xD;
        on-line movie script, CD-ROM-based, or a hardcopy book with a set of predefined exercises.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine organizational units of the tutorial. For example, will the tutorial be organized based on functionality&#xD;
        (what) or on usage (how).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop graphics and exercises to support the intent of the tutorial.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop tutorial text. Remember to partition text into small, focused units. Users read at different speeds and at&#xD;
        different comprehension levels. If an on-line movie is used, check the timing between displays to ensure that any&#xD;
        user can read and understand the text before the next text set is displayed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>Develop other user support material, which may include items such as: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Executive summaries&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Posters&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Start planning and developing User Support Materials early in the product development cycle.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that user support materials are created and tested for accessibility compliance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze who will use this material and in what situation when choosing the delivery medium.&amp;nbsp; For example: a&#xD;
        vibrant but detailed product brochure could be used for marketing and customer evaluation.&amp;nbsp; A planning tool&#xD;
        (as opposed to a book) might better help a customer determine how to install and configure the product.&amp;nbsp; A&#xD;
        hypertext help tool with a CD-ROM might eliminate the need for a hardcopy user manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a software product, the User Support Materials comprise everything shipped in the box other than the software&#xD;
    itself. Different User Support Materials may be delivered on different media, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Printed manuals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On-line help&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computer files&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Web sites&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multi-media presentations, including transcripts and captions for the audio&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Videos, including video descriptions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Glossy brochures, posters, and other user support materials may serve different purposes, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Guide: &quot;How-to&quot; or procedural information that provides mainly task-oriented information. If markedly&#xD;
        different sets of users perform very different tasks, it may be appropriate to produce separate user guides such as&#xD;
        an accessibility section that includes information on the accessibility features (such as keyboard shortcuts)&#xD;
        available.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Conceptual or background information (&quot;why&quot;). A separate concepts book may be required, depending on the complexity&#xD;
        and novelty of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Reference: Provides descriptive information (&quot;what&quot;) organized for quick retrieval. For example, a command&#xD;
        reference is organized alphabetically, or a message manual is organized by message number. A User Reference may not&#xD;
        be necessary. A well-designed index and glossary in the User's Guide may eliminate the need for a separate User's&#xD;
        Reference. Well-designed on-line messages, with links to help panels, may eliminate the need for a message manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quick Reference Card.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Manager's Overview.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Administrator's Guide.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Early in a project, consider providing alternate formats of printed material for people who cannot access the printed&#xD;
    page. Audio cassette, online, or Braille are examples of alternate formats that are available. Thinking of this&#xD;
    provision early in a project enables you to budget time and resources for the alternate formats.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some information may appear in more than one deliverable. For example, the content of the quick reference guide will&#xD;
    most likely come from the user guide, reference guide, or help panels. The index items or glossary terms and&#xD;
    definitions may be used both in a hardcopy manual and in the on-line help.&#xD;

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development of the Deployment Plan starts early in the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do not wait until the deployment of the system is imminent to beginning the initial drafts of the document.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the Deployment Plan with the client and all users, including anyone in areas such as systems administration,&#xD;
        database, LAN, and HVAC whose systems or jobs may be involved with the new system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Obtain client sign-off on all the deployment criteria outlined in the Deployment Plan to help ensure&#xD;
        formal&amp;nbsp;stakeholder approval of the new system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the system is being deployed in multiple releases, the Deployment Plan should relate back to the Release&#xD;
        Plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multiple releases imply multiple deployment periods. The issues associated with each period should be considered&#xD;
        when deciding on the content of a specific release.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Post-Live support procedures should be in place or well under construction by the time the Deployment and cut-over&#xD;
        plan is actually started.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Plan describes the organization, strategy, resources, and methods used to deploy the new application at&#xD;
    customer sites. The plan identifies the responsibilities of everyone participating in the deployment and is written&#xD;
    from the user's perspective. The Deployment Plan also serves as the project's master document over the migration&#xD;
    period. As such, it contains the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan validates that the proposed solution actually is ready for deployment. It contains the steps needed to&#xD;
        make sure that the solution hardware, software, and documentation are in place to proceed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the people are trained and ready to support the new system. This includes the user, support&#xD;
        and temporary deployment communities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the organization is ready to accept the delivery of the proposed solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the proper level of contingency planning has taken place and that the appropriate risk&#xD;
        mitigation procedures are ready.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;
