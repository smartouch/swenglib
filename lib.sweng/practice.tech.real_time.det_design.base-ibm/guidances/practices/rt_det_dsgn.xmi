    From the standpoint of this practice, analysis focuses on the essential and functional properties of a system while&#xD;
    design focuses on its optimization and deployment aspects. These design practices exist at three levels of concern.&#xD;
    Architectural design optimizes the system at a gross, overall level. Collaborative (also known as &quot;mechanistic&quot;) design&#xD;
    optimizes collaborations within the architectural. Detailed design optimizes individual classes, objects, functions,&#xD;
    data structures and types. At all levels, design proceeds primarily by identifying and ranking the optimization&#xD;
    criteria of concern, identifying design patterns and technical solutions that are consistent with the weighted set of&#xD;
    design criteria, applying the design patterns and technologies, and verifying the instantiated design solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Real-Time Detailed Design (RTDD) practice optimizes individual classes, objects, functions, data structures, and&#xD;
    types. This is the lowest level of design and is performed by applying design patterns at this primitive level, often&#xD;
    known as idioms. In practice, most of the concern at this level of design is placed upon elements that are special in&#xD;
    terms of their complexity, criticality, or impact on system performance.&#xD;
