    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Executing the process -- not defining it -- is the real challenge for organizations focused on capability improvement.&#xD;
    Project teams must know where to start, how to proceed, and how to apply the process and tools effectively in real&#xD;
    projects.&amp;nbsp;The only process that really matters is the one people actually use.&amp;nbsp;Real change only occurs when&#xD;
    peoples' daily habits change, and that requires doing and practicing over time. Change efforts based on &quot;telling and&#xD;
    teaching&quot; or coercion almost never succeed. People change when they are motivated to apply the necessary effort.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Getting Started&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Establish a mentoring program&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mentoring is the key to successful&amp;nbsp;adoption of process and tools.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Create a&amp;nbsp;Center&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;Capability organization with well defined mentoring roles&amp;nbsp;to provide deployment support to projects.&#xD;
    Experience shows that using mentors is crucial if you want the implementation of a new process to succeed. If you do&#xD;
    not have mentors, there is&amp;nbsp;a clear risk that the people on the project will fall back into their old habits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The mentor acts as a driver of change. It is important that the process mentor understands the significance of being a&#xD;
    change driver and makes sure that the work progresses. It is also important that the mentor becomes dispensable and&#xD;
    that there is an end to&amp;nbsp;the mentoring effort.&amp;nbsp;Therefore, the mentor needs to transfer both knowledge and&#xD;
    responsibilities to members of the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mentors must cultivate trust by getting to know team members, the problem domain, and project objectives. Unless they&#xD;
    are deeply engaged, it is difficult for mentors to add value. Mentors help people focus on doing without having to&#xD;
    figuring out what to do. They build confidence in the outcome of a change because they have been successful on other&#xD;
    projects. This confidence builds resilience within the team so that it can recover from the inevitable setbacks that&#xD;
    will occur during the change effort. Of course, the mentor's ultimate goal is to build enough expertise and confidence&#xD;
    within the project team for them to support the new way of working without external help.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Distribute process ownership and demonstrate value&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Distribute ownership for the process among&amp;nbsp;project teams adopting the improvements.&amp;nbsp;With this&amp;nbsp;approach&#xD;
    teams are&amp;nbsp;more likely to adopt and learn the new process faster. The result is better when the &quot;real experts,&quot;&#xD;
    those people on the project,&amp;nbsp;evolve&amp;nbsp;it themselves. Evolve&amp;nbsp;process descriptions, tool configurations and&#xD;
    usage models incrementally based on&amp;nbsp;lessons learned and feedback from projects.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Demonstrate the value of process and tool improvements&amp;nbsp;in real projects. Show how effective use of the new&#xD;
    capabilities helps&amp;nbsp;achieve technical and business results quickly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Measure the value and success of deployments using metrics&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the expected value of mentoring efforts and identify&amp;nbsp;metrics to monitor progress and performance against&#xD;
    objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When there is no concrete mandate to adopt (by project, by date) adoption is at risk. Ensure empowered program&#xD;
        management is in place with clear objectives and measures.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Confirm sufficient numbers of qualified and skilled mentors to meet adoption objectives. If needed, obtain outside&#xD;
        resources or scale back deployment plans.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lack of buy-in from development groups is a common pitfall for process and tool improvement efforts. The Center of&#xD;
        Capability must evangelize the improvements and address concerns of managers to generate demand.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When mentoring and technology costs are charged to projects, resistance is elevated. Eliminate this barrier to&#xD;
        adoption by funding mentoring and adoption costs at the enterprise level for cost neutrality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ad hoc mentoring with no structure in place rarely works. Mentoring must be part of these practitioners' formal job&#xD;
        responsibilities so that they can give it the proper amount of attention. It should not be a spare time task that&#xD;
        they feel obliged to push off in favor of more critical activities. The organization should recognize and reward&#xD;
        mentoring as a key leadership skill.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Management often expects&amp;nbsp;a high linear rate of adoption, but this is not realistic. Deployment progresses&#xD;
        slower initially as configurations and deployment models must be adjusted to facilitate early wins. With the&#xD;
        achievement of credible wins, peer endorsements will influence greater acceptance. Nevertheless, at some point&#xD;
        demand exceeds skilled deployment capacity, thus limiting the adoption rate. Without separation of deployment,&#xD;
        support, and administrative functions, the adoption rate will eventually plateau. However, developing standards,&#xD;
        automated administration, and more skilled resources along the way can restore/accelerate the adoption rate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
