    An&amp;nbsp;effective&amp;nbsp;approach to&amp;nbsp;scheduling workshops is to work within&amp;nbsp;the context of the&amp;nbsp;project&#xD;
    lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hold a workshop early in the project&amp;nbsp;to create the overall project plan, the initial iteration plan, and other&#xD;
    plans&amp;nbsp;within the associated&amp;nbsp;discipline of the&amp;nbsp;process or tool improvements (e.g.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    requirements management or change management plans). Define your iteration plans to introduce just enough process or&#xD;
    tool capabilities&amp;nbsp;to meet the iteration's objectives. That way, the project team can learn the process by applying&#xD;
    it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the transition point between iterations, hold another workshop to review iteration results, plan the next iteration,&#xD;
    and identify issues and action plans. Include mid-project adjustments to the process of the project. You can adjust to&#xD;
    the pace of process adoption.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hold follow-on mentoring workshops to help team members develop the skills they need to execute the iteration plan. For&#xD;
    example, during the Inception phase, project teams will need to understand the problem and create a vision for the&#xD;
    solution.&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;workshop led by an experienced facilitator/mentor is the most effective way to make progress on&#xD;
    this front.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the iterations, mentors should work with the team to guide them in new process activities identified in the&#xD;
    iteration plans, which result in the creation of artifacts. Mentors can help team members learn how to play their roles&#xD;
    in the process and perform&amp;nbsp;tasks in the tools&amp;nbsp;with increasing proficiency as the project progresses. This&#xD;
    approach is called experiential learning (or learning by doing). If you think of software development as a kind of team&#xD;
    sport, then the mentor is a team coach who helps players achieve better results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The mentoring sessions generally need to continue from Inception to Elaboration. For a project team of 10 people, 6-8&#xD;
    hours of mentoring/week may be sufficient.Plan for&amp;nbsp;12-15 days of mentoring over 12-15 weeks (from Inception to&#xD;
    Elaboration). The effort estimate&amp;nbsp;will vary based on current state, future state, and time available to get to the&#xD;
    future state.&lt;br />&#xD;
