    There are 5 levels of learning:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Level 1 Basic Knowledge: Awareness of the basic concepts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Level 2 Understanding: Able to understand and apply the knowledge with some help, able to solve simple problems&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Level 3 Application: Able to apply the knowledge to solve problems without help&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Level 4 Judgment: Able to apply knowledge in various complex situations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Level 5 Synthesis: Master of the domain. Can identify weakness of the domain and develop &quot;new knowledge&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    For successful adoption of software development capability improvements, training is important but not sufficient.&#xD;
    After a training class most people will be at Level 1, few will be at Level 2. Practitioners need to be at Level 3 to&#xD;
    apply the knowledge effectively. Mentoring support is needed&amp;nbsp;to achieve Level 3. A mentor is a Level 4 or Level 5&#xD;
    practitioner in a his/her domain.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most learners get only basic knowledge from a training class. They have to apply this knowledge to real problems in&#xD;
    order to become truly capable. That is hard to do if you are fresh out of a basic training class unless you are working&#xD;
    with a skilled mentor. Mentors can help learners quickly advance to the second and third learning stages and then&#xD;
    support them in stages 4 and 5, as the learners gain more experience. It takes time and experience to hone the good&#xD;
    judgment necessary for these stages, and there are no shortcuts.&lt;br />&#xD;
