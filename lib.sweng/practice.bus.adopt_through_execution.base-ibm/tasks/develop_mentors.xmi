    Assess projects across the organization&amp;nbsp;for delivery performance and target capabilities, identifying strong&#xD;
    mentoring&amp;nbsp;candidates for formalized skill development under the support, direction, and mentoring of senior CoC&#xD;
    members.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establish practice forums, educational seminars, and targeted&amp;nbsp;Human Resources&amp;nbsp;initiatives to attract,&#xD;
    develop, and promote CoC talent.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Get&amp;nbsp; buy-in and a confirmation of support&amp;nbsp;from each candidate's manager. They must be made aware that the&#xD;
    mentor will need dedicated time&amp;nbsp;to perform&amp;nbsp;mentoring activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Initially, unless you have experts on staff, you will need to hire mentors from outside your organization. Over time,&#xD;
    these external mentors will transfer knowledge to resident mentors in your organization, so that they can support the&#xD;
    process and tools on their own. Typically these are senior, experienced practitioners who can lead.. When they are&#xD;
    ready, these professionals will divide their time between applying the process and tools&amp;nbsp;in real projects (60 to&#xD;
    70 percent) and mentoring other projects (30 to 40 percent).&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Provide training that helps the mentor to understand their role. Their mission is to enable project teams to be&#xD;
    self-sufficient, not to simply execute&amp;nbsp;and be watched.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mentors must learn how to assess progress of adoption&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;progress of skill development.&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that candidates have practical, hands-on knowledge of the needed skill area. Theoretical-only knowledge often&#xD;
    results in the creation of too many artifacts or the performance of&amp;nbsp;unnecessary activities&amp;nbsp;on projects. This&#xD;
    can cause&amp;nbsp;the practitioners being mentored to become overwhelmed and confused. It can also result in a loss of&#xD;
    credibility for the CoC.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, mentors split their time between practicing and mentoring,&amp;nbsp;ensuring that they have current knowledge in&#xD;
    their respective disciplines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Successful mentors are not only experienced practitioners, they must have&amp;nbsp;great people skills.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mentoring will have to be part of these practitioners' &amp;nbsp;formal job responsibilities so that they can give it the&#xD;
    proper amount of attention. It should not be a spare time task that they feel obliged to push off in favor of more&#xD;
    critical activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>Ensure that mentors have the proper training and experience&amp;nbsp;to effectively transfer skills to project&amp;nbsp;team&#xD;
members through hands-on project mentoring.&lt;br /></purpose>
