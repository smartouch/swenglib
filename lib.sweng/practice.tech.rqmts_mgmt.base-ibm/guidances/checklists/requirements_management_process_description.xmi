    <sectionDescription>If your project is similar to others in your organization that already have well-defined requirements management&#xD;
strategies, use those strategies. If they are not documented clearly, document them for use in your project as well as&#xD;

    Extending the Requirements Management practice is an ideal way to capture the requirements management process&#xD;
    description. This requires knowledge of the IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Method Composer tool, and the Unified Method Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Alternatively, you can record the process in the document and diagramming tools used to capture the workflows. See &lt;a&#xD;
