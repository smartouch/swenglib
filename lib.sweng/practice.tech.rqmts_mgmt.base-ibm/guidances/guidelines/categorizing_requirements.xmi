    Requirement categorization is important, because requirements in different categories usually have different&#xD;
    stakeholders, reviewers, and approvers, and they behave differently throughout the project lifecycle. Categorization&#xD;
    also allows a team better control and organization over a large set of requirements.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The requirement categories or types needed for the project&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be identified early on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the highest level, requirements&amp;nbsp;can be categorized as business requirements and system requirements. Business&#xD;
    Requirements would consist of the stakeholder needs and features. System requirements are usually broken into&#xD;
    functional (use cases and other system-wide functional requirements) and non functional requirements. These in turn can&#xD;
    be categorized as Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Supportability (URPS). These (URPS) are the most common&#xD;
    categories, but there&amp;nbsp;might be others as well. For instance, your organization&amp;nbsp;might have regulatory&#xD;
    requirements to fulfill.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some projects&amp;nbsp;might also need to capture business rule requirements, report specifications, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a requirement is first captured, it&amp;nbsp;needs to&amp;nbsp;be analyzed to ensure that it is categorized correctly. The&#xD;
    exact mechanism for categorizing requirements will vary based upon how the requirements are documented and organized,&#xD;
    and whether a requirements management tool is used. If documents are used to capture the requirement set, a simple&#xD;
    method of categorization is to have a separate document for each requirement category, and a different document section&#xD;
    for each requirement type. A larger, more complex requirement set needs a more sophisticated method of categorization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The analyst can use tools&amp;nbsp;to assign a category when each requirement is created. Information can be sorted and&#xD;
    filtered by requirement type, and tools can ensure that all requirements of a certain type behave the same way. An&#xD;
    example would be to ensure that all use cases have a matching set of test cases.&lt;br />&#xD;
