  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Requirements Management Process Description describes the requirements artifacts, requirement types, their&#xD;
    respective requirements attributes, how requirements traceability will be managed, and specifies the information to be&#xD;
    collected and tracked. It also specifies how requirements changes will be managed, as well as addressing requirements&#xD;
    organization, tool automation, the necessary reports, views, and queries that will be generated and the related&#xD;
    processes for requirements and requirements change management.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To document decisions made by the organization on how to document and manage their project requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reuse on future projects with a similar profile.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To promote standardization of the requirements management process within the project team and the organization as a&#xD;
        whole&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inconsistency in documenting and managing requirements within the project team and the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inconsistent organization of requirements and tool use.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Poorly understood requirements and change management process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Incorrect use of various requirement and document types in a large complex requirement set.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A lengthy and formal Requirements Management Plan&amp;nbsp;might not be necessary for small projects with a simple&#xD;
    requirements set and a well-defined requirements management strategy and process. This is particularly true if the&#xD;
    analyst team is very familiar with the process.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>Most of the information in this artifact can captured as a word document. It is also possible to capture all or part of&#xD;
this information as an extension of the requirements management practice. Dynamic processes, which can be depicted&#xD;
effectively by using activity and workflow diagrams, could use the Rational Method Composer. If this is not feasible, the&#xD;
processes can be included in the word document along with all related information.</representationOptions>
