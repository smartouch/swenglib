  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are a number of work products created in a modern software-centric development project. Any of them may be&#xD;
    subject to a review meeting, depending on the delivery process in which they are created. Some of these include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements specification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems engineering models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architectural Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project schedules&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software or hardware design models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software source code&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test cases, procedures, and results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plans: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Software Development Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Quality Assurance Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Software Verification Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Verification and Validation Test Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Configuration Management Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to inject quality into work products is through careful engineering and demonstration and test via&#xD;
    execution or simulation. For many of these work products, execution isn't feasible, so reviews are a way of assessing&#xD;
    the quality of the work product. In addition, many work products must conform to guidelines, standards or templates and&#xD;
    this is most easily demonstrated through a review process. Lastly, reviews also serve to disseminate information to&#xD;
    different stakeholders about the structure, content, and quality of a work product.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are &lt;em>very&lt;/em> expensive to perform but, when performed well,&amp;nbsp;are highly valuable. It is crucial that&#xD;
    they be performed effectively. Identified issues should be solved outside of the meeting. Subsequent reviews need only&#xD;
    go over the lists of actions from the meeting to ensure each issue has been appropriately addressed. This means that&#xD;
    the list of actions is an essential artifact for effective reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is crucial to understand that reviews are not a replacement for good modeling in the first place. One of the basic&#xD;
    requirements prior to reviewing is that the model &lt;em>executes properly&lt;/em>. In a PIM review process, this means that&#xD;
    it is debugged and can replicate (via execution) the use case scenarios. In a PSM review process, this means that the&#xD;
    model has passed formal unit testing. You should NEVER find a compilation problem in a review meeting; it is far&#xD;
    cheaper to have the product owner find that on their own &lt;em>prior to planning the review&lt;/em> rather than find it in a&#xD;
    room full of people. The intent of the review should be to evaluate an set of already high-quality artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is also very important to &lt;em>stay focused&lt;/em> during the review. The meeting leader needs to rule with a (silk&#xD;
    covered) iron fist. Reviews are very expensive so the object is to perform the intent of the review as efficiently as&#xD;
    possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: subsequent reviews of an already-reviewed work product should focus exclusively on the list of actions from the&#xD;
    previous review.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Real models are too large to be reviewed in their entirety in a single review. Each review must have a specific purpose&#xD;
    or intent, and subsequently examine only the subset of the model relevant to that purpose. Some common review intents&#xD;
    are to perform the following actions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate and understand systems engineering handoff models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate the use cases and their details&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate object analysis (platform-independent) models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate design (platform-specific) models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate the adequacy and coverage of a test plan and its details&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evaluate the result of the actions taken after a previous review&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this step, the material is gathered together for a review. There are almost always multiple artifacts that are&#xD;
    reviewed together. For example, a review of a use case model usually includes the following artifacts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Relevant use case diagrams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Corresponding requirement text&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use case sequence diagrams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use case state machines&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        QoS constraints&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use case descriptions&#xD;

        List of actions from previous reviews (if applicable)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the review of an object analysis model, common artifacts include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For each use case in the object analysis model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;

                Class diagram(s) showing the collaboration of elements realizing the use case&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Original use case sequence diagrams&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Elaborated sequence diagrams showing the interaction&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                State machine diagrams for stateful classes&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Activity diagrams for complex algorithms&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                List of actions from previous reviews (if applicable)&#xD;
