    Revisit and refine&amp;nbsp;the user roles and user stories that you identified&amp;nbsp;during the initial brainstorming&#xD;
    sessions with stakeholders. The purpose of this is to achieve agreement with stakeholders that the set of user roles, personas, and user stories is a good baseline for prioritization, planning, and detailing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task re-occurs many times throughout the development lifecycle, often as part of iteration planning.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Well-written user stories possess&amp;nbsp;the characteristics defined in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.user_story_driven_dev.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/invest_model_2D82989.html&quot; guid=&quot;_K8khID55Ed6FxpOwnkUDmw&quot;>INVEST Model&lt;/a>. For example, one of the characteristics of a good user story is that&#xD;
    it can be tested even before development begins. This makes the user story valuable to stakeholders in a practical way.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    User stories capture the intended functionality of the system under development, from the user role&#xD;
    perspective.&amp;nbsp;They are simple, clear, brief descriptions written&amp;nbsp;using business language in the context in&#xD;
    which the need or capability&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;used in the system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user story is in fact a reminder for further conversation between the team and stakeholders. User stories&amp;nbsp;are&#xD;
    written down, but they are not meant to be contractual, or even interpreted without further discussions with the&#xD;
    stakeholders. The on-going interaction between stakeholders and the team (to discuss the details of a user story) are&#xD;
    more important than the resulting textual description itself.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p> A user role&amp;nbsp;represents users of the system under development who have &#xD;
  similar attributes. These are some of the common attributes that differentiate &#xD;
  user roles from each other: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Frequency of using the software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p> During the conversations with stakeholders, the team identifies and captures &#xD;

  &lt;li>Exceptions and error conditions &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li>Different types of users that might exist&lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>These conditions, also called&lt;em> story&amp;nbsp;confirmations&lt;/em>, help the team&amp;nbsp;create &#xD;
  test cases to be&amp;nbsp;conducted so that they can later evaluate whether the &#xD;
  user story is complete and accepted by stakeholders. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Detailing user stories does not&amp;nbsp;imply that all&amp;nbsp;user stories&amp;nbsp;will &#xD;

  will vary, depending upon the needs of the project and the complexity of the &#xD;
  user story.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Nonfunctional requirements (such as expected performance, availability, adherence &#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&amp;nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you&#xD;
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer&#xD;
    could&amp;nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new&#xD;
    elements to take its place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&amp;nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the&#xD;
    architecture within which the design exists.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally&#xD;
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task will be applied numerous times.&amp;nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&amp;nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and&#xD;
    reusable elements.&amp;nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing&#xD;
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate&#xD;
    while designing this portion of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&amp;nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and&#xD;
    consistency across the design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&amp;nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small&#xD;
    subset of requirements.&amp;nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,&#xD;
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some&#xD;
    scenario.&amp;nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&amp;nbsp;again later&amp;nbsp;to deal with a different context on the&#xD;
    same requirements.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&amp;nbsp;to the users, all&#xD;
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it&#xD;
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database&#xD;
    access, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In&#xD;
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more&#xD;
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity&#xD;
    to the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,&#xD;
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test&#xD;
    additional behavior.&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;
    focus on divergent, seemingly independent issues of how the system will be put together and work, they should fit&#xD;
    together without contradiction.&lt;br />&#xD;

    worked on are completed here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

        Automate tests via a unit regression testing tool (for example, xUnit) so that tests may be run by developers&#xD;

        Test to the risk of the implementation element. For example, the more critical an element is, the more important it&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units&#xD;
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the&#xD;
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,&#xD;
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test&#xD;
    additional behavior.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as&#xD;
    specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has&#xD;
    run correctly.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is best when developer tests already exist so there is an unambiguous definition of what behavior is considered&#xD;
    correct. The implementation should be immediately tested.&#xD;

    A portion of the design is implemented by performing this task. This task can be performed any number of times during&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;

    The development of the Deployment Plan starts early in the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do not wait until the deployment of the system is imminent to beginning the initial drafts of the document.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the Deployment Plan with the client and all users, including anyone in areas such as systems administration,&#xD;
        database, LAN, and HVAC whose systems or jobs may be involved with the new system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Obtain client sign-off on all the deployment criteria outlined in the Deployment Plan to help ensure&#xD;

        If the system is being deployed in multiple releases, the Deployment Plan should relate back to the Release&#xD;
        Plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Multiple releases imply multiple deployment periods. The issues associated with each period should be considered&#xD;
        when deciding on the content of a specific release.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Post-Live support procedures should be in place or well under construction by the time the Deployment and cut-over&#xD;

&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Plan describes the organization, strategy, resources, and methods used to deploy the new application at&#xD;
    customer sites. The plan identifies the responsibilities of everyone participating in the deployment and is written&#xD;
    from the user's perspective. The Deployment Plan also serves as the project's master document over the migration&#xD;
    period. As such, it contains the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        make sure that the solution hardware, software, and documentation are in place to proceed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the people are trained and ready to support the new system. This includes the user, support&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze who will use this material and in what situation when choosing the delivery medium.&amp;nbsp; For example: a&#xD;
        vibrant but detailed product brochure could be used for marketing and customer evaluation.&amp;nbsp; A planning tool&#xD;
        (as opposed to a book) might better help a customer determine how to install and configure the product.&amp;nbsp; A&#xD;
        hypertext help tool with a CD-ROM might eliminate the need for a hardcopy user manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a software product, the User Support Materials comprise everything shipped in the box other than the software&#xD;
    itself. Different User Support Materials may be delivered on different media, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Printed manuals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On-line help&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computer files&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reference cards&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hypertext&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Web sites&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multi-media presentations, including transcripts and captions for the audio&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Videos, including video descriptions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Glossy brochures, posters, and other user support materials may serve different purposes, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Guide: &quot;How-to&quot; or procedural information that provides mainly task-oriented information. If markedly&#xD;
        different sets of users perform very different tasks, it may be appropriate to produce separate user guides such as&#xD;
        an accessibility section that includes information on the accessibility features (such as keyboard shortcuts)&#xD;
        available.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Conceptual or background information (&quot;why&quot;). A separate concepts book may be required, depending on the complexity&#xD;
        and novelty of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User Reference: Provides descriptive information (&quot;what&quot;) organized for quick retrieval. For example, a command&#xD;
        reference is organized alphabetically, or a message manual is organized by message number. A User Reference may not&#xD;
        be necessary. A well-designed index and glossary in the User's Guide may eliminate the need for a separate User's&#xD;
        Reference. Well-designed on-line messages, with links to help panels, may eliminate the need for a message manual.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quick Reference Card.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Manager's Overview.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tutorial or Introductory Tour.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Samples.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation Guide.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations Guide.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Administrator's Guide.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Early in a project, consider providing alternate formats of printed material for people who cannot access the printed&#xD;
    page. Audio cassette, online, or Braille are examples of alternate formats that are available. Thinking of this&#xD;
    provision early in a project enables you to budget time and resources for the alternate formats.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some information may appear in more than one deliverable. For example, the content of the quick reference guide will&#xD;
    most likely come from the user guide, reference guide, or help panels. The index items or glossary terms and&#xD;
    definitions may be used both in a hardcopy manual and in the on-line help.&#xD;

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The review of the high-level service design at the beginning of the development of this work product provides the&#xD;
    opportunity to educate new project team members and have them understand the solution as designed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on how the IT Services Detailed Design work product output is going to be used, it may not be necessary to&#xD;
    develop the workflow charts (e.g. LOVEM charts).&amp;nbsp; The narratives and task/job/data/tool table may be sufficient to&#xD;
    meet the requirements of the engagement.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;include the tasks executed, the job function that performs the task, and the technology (both&#xD;
    applications (or tool) and data) that is used to perform the task. In addition, the work product clearly describes the&#xD;
    relationship of the tasks to the job functions and the technology. This work product has the following characteristics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The job functions are shown using the defined job names of those jobs participating in the execution of the tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools/applications are named and, ideally, specific functions and/or user interfaces are referenced.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The data fields used for each task are named and their source is identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The flow of information from one task to another is identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;

        Defects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test motivator is usually an external file that provides details about a test plan or test case. For example, a test&#xD;
    motivator file could be a document or spreadsheet containing detailed information about a specific test plan or test&#xD;
    case. It is convenient to be able to reference a test motivator file from a test plan and test case record. Test&#xD;
    motivators are useful in linking test requirements with test plans and test cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div class=&quot;p&quot;>&#xD;
    You can use associations between test plan and test case records with a test motivator to determine: &#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;
    decisions about what testing will be undertaken, and how the test effort will be conducted.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>Requirement attributes help the project team understand, prioritize, manage, track and validate the project requirements.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;
to capture critical information about each requirement. The information that is captured in the attributes can used to&#xD;
generate views and reports, which are used to track and measure progress.</refinedDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are project resource costs to establishing and maintaining traceability. It is important to establish just enough&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;

    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;

    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,&#xD;
    implementation, and deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various&#xD;
    stakeholders, reducing technical risks, and ensuring that decisions are effectively communicated, validated, and&#xD;
    followed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role works closely with project managers in staffing and planning the project, because it is recommended&#xD;
    that the team be organized around the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role also works closely with analysts and developers to make sure that the architecturally significant&#xD;
    requirements are assigned to the proper components of the system. &#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While planning the iteration at the&amp;nbsp;sub team&amp;nbsp;level, consider doing the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work with the project leadership team to define iteration objectives and evaluation criteria, as well as commit&#xD;
        work to an iteration.&amp;nbsp;The objectives help determine the stories that should be mapped to the iteration. Use&#xD;
        the project-level iteration plan as input to create&amp;nbsp;your team's iteration plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Based on the iteration assessment, report to the project leadership team those items that may affect the project&#xD;
        definition and scope.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;

    implementation, and deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;

    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;

    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;

properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;

    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as&#xD;
    specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has&#xD;
    run correctly.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Extension Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Report Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interface Specifications&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How a combination of these will be used to support the client's business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications define the boundaries between the different units of user documentation, as well as:&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>Requirement attributes help the project team understand, prioritize, manage, track and validate the project requirements.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

One or multiple storyboards may be defined for a use case, thereby supporting a use-case-driven approach to software engineering, as well as providing an excellent means to validate the user's (actor's) expectations of these use cases and their role in the use-case flows of events.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as&#xD;
    specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has&#xD;
    run correctly.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In selecting the media for the user documentation take into the consideration the ease of maintenance, i.e., how will&#xD;
    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;

    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&amp;nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you&#xD;
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer&#xD;
    could&amp;nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new&#xD;
    elements to take its place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&amp;nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the&#xD;
    architecture within which the design exists.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally&#xD;
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task will be applied numerous times.&amp;nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&amp;nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and&#xD;
    reusable elements.&amp;nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing&#xD;
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate&#xD;
    while designing this portion of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&amp;nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and&#xD;
    consistency across the design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&amp;nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small&#xD;
    subset of requirements.&amp;nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,&#xD;
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some&#xD;
    scenario.&amp;nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&amp;nbsp;again later&amp;nbsp;to deal with a different context on the&#xD;
    same requirements.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&amp;nbsp;to the users, all&#xD;
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it&#xD;
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database&#xD;
    access, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In&#xD;
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more&#xD;
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity&#xD;
    to the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>Requirement attributes help the project team understand, prioritize, manage, track and validate the project requirements.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;
to capture critical information about each requirement. The information that is captured in the attributes can used to&#xD;
generate views and reports, which are used to track and measure progress.</refinedDescription>

    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;

    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;

properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;

    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;

    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;

    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;

    implementation, and deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;

    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;

    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;

    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>A project requirement does not just consist of the description of the requirement. Each requirement needs a set of&#xD;
properties - called attributes -&amp;nbsp;that capture important information about it. And requirements that belong to&#xD;
different categories&amp;nbsp;can have a different set of attributes. All requirements&amp;nbsp;must have a core set of attributes&#xD;

    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;

        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;

    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;

        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinate the User Support Specifications with the end user training material specifications to avoid having to cover&#xD;
    the same topics twice - unless it is on purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In writing the User Support Specifications, re-use as much as possible of the:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package Design Documentation&#xD;

    the documentation be updated, is the documentation accessible, and how will it be distributed.&amp;nbsp; Should the&#xD;
    documentation be on-line on a server, and should some of it be kept in hard copy as a back up in case the server is&#xD;
    inaccessible?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This must be done in conjunction with the development of user training materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specifications are the work descriptions for the development of the various units of user documentation.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The User Support Specifications should cover:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The configuration of the standard package, including accessibility and package extensions that have been developed.&#xD;

        The reports and interfaces that have been developed. &#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way&#xD;
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT&#xD;
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must&#xD;
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service&#xD;
    portfolio or service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides&#xD;
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of&#xD;
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are&#xD;
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being&#xD;
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail&#xD;
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the&#xD;
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or&#xD;
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service&#xD;
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Software Distribution Plan is part of a systems management project or part of an IT system architecture Operational&#xD;
    Model. The Software Distribution Plan includes the data required to allow the operations department to perform the&#xD;
    software configuration, installation, and distribution (CID) process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generating a Software Distribution Plan is a way to avoid significant adverse impact on end users and IT infrastructure&#xD;
    due to changes and the overall cost of distributing the solution. The plan, when implemented, will provide end users,&#xD;
    who are accepting a new application and possibly new hardware, with the ability to restore their systems to a known&#xD;
    state on short notice. Downtime, due to user error or system disruption, cannot be tolerated in mission critical&#xD;
    applications, such as a call center for a telephone company or other utility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Full automation of the software distribution process is not always necessary, but the plan will identify the cost&#xD;
    benefit of automation. The information collected in the plan will be valuable for any mixture of manual and automated&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;

    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    This working version of the system or part of the system&amp;nbsp;is the result of putting the implementation through a&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;
    focus on divergent, seemingly independent issues of how the system will be put together and work, they should fit&#xD;
    together without contradiction.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as&#xD;
    specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has&#xD;
    run correctly.&#xD;
