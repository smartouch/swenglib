    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewing the test approach, itemize and characterize the key aspects of the test approach. Using this information,&#xD;
    review the software architecture and begin to formulate an understanding of the general environmental needs for the&#xD;
    testing effort.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Using the software architecture as a starting point, locate and review the deployment model and associated information.&#xD;
    Identify each specific target environment that the software will be deployed on, and become familiar with the&#xD;
    distinguishing characteristics of each.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    It is not usually practical to set up and administer a large number of test environments. Economies of scale usually&#xD;
    force you to accepting a limited subset of the possible target environments that you could test. Make a list of all of&#xD;
    the target environments that you have identified, and look for ways to consolidate and reduce the list to a manageable&#xD;
    subset. It is typical for both base hardware and operating system software to be shared across multiple test&#xD;
    environments.&#xD;
&lt;/div></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_UPcugHdeEdyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="For each Test Environment Configuration " guid="_UPcugHdeEdyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each Test Environment Configuration that you have identified that you should perform your testing against, identify&#xD;
    and define the following details.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;IdentifySpecificNeeds&quot; name=&quot;IdentifySpecificNeeds&quot;>Identify specific environment needs for each test&#xD;
    technique&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the Test Plan, identify each technique that will be part of the Test Approach. For each technique, list the&#xD;
    specific environmental requirements that will need to be satisfied to allow the testing to be undertaken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;DefineBaseInventory&quot; name=&quot;DefineBaseInventory&quot;>Define inventory of base hardware and software&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the requirements that you have identified, begin collating a list of both the hardware and software that will be&#xD;
    require to conduct the testing. Try to find opportunities for consolidation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;DefineTestInventory&quot; name=&quot;DefineTestInventory&quot;>Define detailed inventory of hardware and software to support&#xD;
    the test process&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now gather the details for each configuration. Be as specific as possible. This may require the assistance of technical&#xD;
    support or system administration resources. Try to find the minimum and maximum extremes for the possible environments.&#xD;
    Often these extremes are enough to provide a sufficient breadth of environment experience.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;DefineEnvironManagement&quot; name=&quot;DefineEnvironManagement&quot;>Define Test Environment management process&#xD;
    requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To set up, maintain, and manage a test environment is often a difficult and demanding undertaking. Give thought to the&#xD;
    management procedures that you will adopt to keep the test environment in good working order.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those&#xD;
    team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use checklists to verify that&#xD;
    quality and completeness are good enough.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people who perform the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input review your interim work. Do this&#xD;
    while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate your work&#xD;
    against the key input work products to make sure that you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It may be&#xD;
    useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
