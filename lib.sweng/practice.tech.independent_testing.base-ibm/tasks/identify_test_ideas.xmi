    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the test-related plans, review the Test Motivators. Motivation may come from one of any number of sources: an&#xD;
    individual work product, a set of work products, an event or activity, or the absence of any of these things. Sources&#xD;
    might include: Risk List, Change Requests, Use Cases, other Requirements work products, UML Models, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is insufficient for a Test-Ideas List to contain a single entry that refers to validating a single source&#xD;
    requirement. That should certainly be &lt;b>one&lt;/b> entry on the list, but a well-formed Test-Ideas List attempts to&#xD;
    advise about quality for a given Target Test Item on many other dimensions, in addition to validating compliance with&#xD;
    specification.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Encourage other test team members to contribute additional test ideas. Consider doing this informally over a &quot;brown bag&#xD;
    lunch&quot;. To stimulate the session, you might read selected excerpts from testing journals, published books, or relevant&#xD;
    mail from test community mail lists.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While this is generally a useful thing to do, it is especially useful and important in situations where there are no&#xD;
    existing Test-Idea Catalogs to reference. See the &quot;More Information&quot; section in the header table of this page for&#xD;
    further guidelines on brainstorming.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_i4aSUHa2Edyn2eJAAk3RHw" name="Refine the Test-Ideas List" guid="_i4aSUHa2Edyn2eJAAk3RHw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is worth getting a broader sampling of feedback. Show your list to interested development staff, customer&#xD;
    representatives, and other stakeholders who might have further ideas to add.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this stage, it is generally better to have too many ideas than too few. Simply refine the list by adding any&#xD;
    additional entries, and remove any entries that are obviously duplicates.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those&#xD;
    team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use checklists to verify that&#xD;
    quality and completeness are good enough.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people who perform the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input review your interim work. Do this&#xD;
    while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate your work&#xD;
    against the key input work products to make sure that you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It may be&#xD;
    useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;

    The purpose of this task is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the individual conditions necessary to realize a test idea in a specific context&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Identify potential points of observation and control for the related test item(s)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify potential oracles to facilitate observation points&#xD;

        Provide consumable resources to support the test&#xD;
