    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start by gathering the Test Logs output during the implementation and execution of the tests. Relevant logs might come&#xD;
    from many sources: they might be captured by the tools that you use (both test execution and diagnostic tools),&#xD;
    generated by custom-written routines that your team has developed, output from the Target Test Items themselves, or&#xD;
    recorded manually by the tester. Gather all of the available Test Log sources and examine their content. Verify that&#xD;
    all of the scheduled testing executed to completion, and that all of the tests were scheduled that should have been.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_VBTnQHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Capture Nontrivial Incident Data" guid="_VBTnQHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to capture any anomalous occurrences: even if you can not reproduce or explain them now, subsequent&#xD;
    incidents with similar symptoms will eventually provide enough information to help isolate what the fault is behind&#xD;
    them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Log as much detail as you can now, but indicate that the incident can not yet be resolved.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_WwwysHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Identify Procedural Errors in the Test " guid="_WwwysHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    it is pretty common that a number of failures will be as a result of errors introduced during the implementation of the&#xD;
    test, or in the management of the test environment. Identify and correct these errors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the test has completed abnormally, preventing other tests from being executed, you might need to recover the test&#xD;
    close to the point of failure, and continue execution of the remaining tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_YlJhcHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Locate and Isolate Failures " guid="_YlJhcHd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The more diagnosis of the failure that you perform, the more likelihood there will be that the fault will eventually be&#xD;
    identified and understood.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to isolate the failure by eliminating Target Test Items that are unlikely to be involved in the failure, and look&#xD;
    for trends and characteristics in the remaining items, system status, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the failure cannot be investigated usefully without reproduction, conduct an analysis of the failure by reproducing&#xD;
    it under controlled conditions. Use diagnostic and debugging tools where helpful.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_bt2-0Hd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Diagnose Failure Symptoms and Characteristics " guid="_bt2-0Hd0Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Attempt to diagnose the underlying fault using your experience of similar incidents that have occurred.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If required and available, enlist assistance form developers, taking advantage of the developers' internal knowledge of&#xD;
    the software to improve the failure analysis.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on your previous experience, try to identify candidate solutions. Work with the available developers to get a&#xD;
    better understanding of the solution space.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those&#xD;
    team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use checklists to verify that&#xD;
    quality and completeness are good enough.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people who perform the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input review your interim work. Do this&#xD;
    while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate your work&#xD;
    against the key input work products to make sure that you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It may be&#xD;
    useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Investigate the Test Log details, and analyze the failures that occurred during test implementation and execution&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Correct failures that result from errors in testing procedure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
