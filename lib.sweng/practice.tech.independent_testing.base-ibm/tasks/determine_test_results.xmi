    <sectionDescription>&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The Test Logs are analyzed to determine the meaningful Test Results, regarding the differences between the expected&#xD;
    results and the actual results of each test. Identify and analyze each incident and failure in turn. Learn as much as&#xD;
    you can about each occurrence.&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check for duplicate incidents, common symptoms and other relationships between incidents. These conditions often&#xD;
    provide valuable insight into the root cause of a group of the incidents.&#xD;

    Differences indicate potential defects in the Target Test Items and should be entered into a tracking system as&#xD;
    incidents or Change Requests, with an indication of the appropriate corrective actions that could be taken.&#xD;

the status and information the data represents.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Present the Test Results for this Test Cycle in a Test Evaluation Summary. This step is to develop the initial draft of&#xD;
    the summary. This is accomplished by assembling the previous information that has been gathered into a readable summary&#xD;
    report. Depending on the stakeholder audience and project context, the actual format and content of the summary will&#xD;
    differ.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Often it is a good idea to distribute the initial draft to a subset of stakeholders to obtain feedback that you can&#xD;
    incorporate before publishing to a broader audience.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_bfDmgHazEdyn2eJAAk3RHw" name="Advise Stakeholders of Key Findings " guid="_bfDmgHazEdyn2eJAAk3RHw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using whatever means is appropriate, publicize this information. We recommend you consider posting these on a&#xD;
    centralized project site, or present them in regularly held status meetings to enable feedback to be gathered and next&#xD;
    actions to be determined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be aware that making evaluation summaries publicly available can sometimes be a sensitive political issue. Negotiate&#xD;
    with the development manager to present results in such a manner that they reflect an honest and accurate summary of&#xD;
    your findings, yet respect the work of the developers.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those&#xD;
    team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use checklists to verify that&#xD;
    quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
