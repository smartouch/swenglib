    The Test Strategy is used to identify testing principles and practices that will be applied in order to mitigate the&#xD;
    project risks, manage the testing risks, and identify any exposures. This artifact provides a common approach and&#xD;
    terminology for the testing effort. It also gives a general direction of where the testing is headed. It emphasizes the&#xD;
    importance of a team approach to testing.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Automation Architecture provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the test-automation system, using a&#xD;
    number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It serves as a means of reasoning&#xD;
    about, managing, and communicating the fundamental characteristics and features of the test-automation software system.&#xD;
    It provides a governing focus for the test-automation software that enables the required system to be realized in&#xD;
    respect to key aspects such as: maintainability, extensibility, reliability, concurrency, distribution, security, and&#xD;
    recovery.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each Test Environment Configuration specifies an appropriate, controlled setting in which to conduct the required test&#xD;
    and evaluation activities. Providing a controlled environment, built from a known configuration in which to conduct&#xD;
    these activities, helps to ensure that the results of these efforts are accurate, valid, and have a higher likelihood&#xD;
    of being systematically reproduced. A well-controlled Test Environment is an important aspect of efficient failure&#xD;
    analysis and fault resolution.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Suite provides a means of managing the complexity of the test implementation. Many system test efforts fail&#xD;
    because the team gets lost in the minutia of all of the detailed tests, and subsequently loses control of the test&#xD;
    effort. Similar to UML packages, Test Suites provide a hierarchy of encapsulating containers to help manage the test&#xD;
    implementation. They provide a means of managing the strategic aspects of the test effort by collecting tests together&#xD;
    in related groups that can be planned, managed, and assessed in a meaningful way.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;
    decisions about what testing will be undertaken, and how the test effort will be conducted.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>This artifact provides a detailed, typically time-based record that both verifies that a set of tests were run, and&#xD;
provides information that relates to the success of those tests. The focus is typically on providing an accurate audit&#xD;
trail, which enables you to undertake a post-run diagnosis of failures. This raw data is subsequently analyzed to determine&#xD;
the results of an aspect of the test effort.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
