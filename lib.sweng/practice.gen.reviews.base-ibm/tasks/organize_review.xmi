&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Review&amp;nbsp;Coordinator starts this task when the current project work plans have been consulted and the need for a&#xD;
    review identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work products mentioned in the &quot;Input Work Products&quot; section define a review framework, providing guidance and&#xD;
    directions with regards to what the overall scope of the reviews should be, when they should take place, who to include&#xD;
    in the review and how reviewers should prepare,&amp;nbsp;what is the level of formalism, and so forth. More detailed&#xD;
    guidance could be found in the the Measurement Plan, the Quality Assurance Plan, the Development Process,&#xD;
    and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Project Specific Guidelines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are various approaches to planning review tasks: these approaches vary based on factors such as team size, team&#xD;
    culture, the required formality of the projects process and the current point in the project lifecycle. Some of the&#xD;
    general techniques used include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Reviews&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp; A meeting at which a work product, or a set of work products are presented to the&#xD;
        user, customer, or other interested parties for comments and approval.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Inspection&lt;/b>. A evaluation technique in which one or more work products are examined in detail by a person or&#xD;
        group other than the author to detect errors. Inspections are considered to be the most productive review&#xD;
        technique, however it requires training, and preparation to perform them well.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Walkthrough&lt;/b>. A review process in which&amp;nbsp;the review coordinator, in this case also a&amp;nbsp;developer,&#xD;
        leads one or more reviewers, possibly members of the development team, through a segment of a work product that he&#xD;
        or she has written while the other members ask questions and make comments about technique, style, possible error,&#xD;
        violation of development standards, and other problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To maximize efficiency and minimize team interruptions, consider planning the reviews in such a way that the required&#xD;
    reviewers can be convened a minimum number of times by having them review as many work products as possible. Obviously&#xD;
    a realistic workload needs to be maintained for each review, so you will need to balance these conflicting needs&#xD;
    accordingly.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_V8PB4dnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA" name=" Inform attendees " guid="_V8PB4dnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to provide attendee's with sufficient notice about the review, and to advise them about what will be&#xD;
    expected of them in terms of both preparatory work and their involvement in the review process itself. Make it clear to&#xD;
    each attendee what stakeholding they are being asked to represent and as such the type of review critique and feedback&#xD;
    you are expecting from them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consult each of the specific review tasks and accompanying guidelines in RUP to determine the criteria for inviting&#xD;
    attendees, the recommended preparatory work for an attendee and the expectations that will be placed on them by&#xD;
    agreeing to attend the review. As some general guidance, you should consider the following stakeholders when inviting&#xD;
    attendees to participate in the review meetings:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The subsequent direct consumers of the work product, including testing and documentation staff.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Peers playing the role as the producer of the work product who will act as domain or subject-matter experts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The producer of the work product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The sponsor or budget holder.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The consumer or users of the final product that will be realized from this work product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to find the right balance between including the desired review participants and keeping the review&#xD;
    manageable and productive. Care should be taken to include only those participants who will contribute to achieving the&#xD;
    objectives of the review. In general, it is usually more productive to hold several focused review sessions with a&#xD;
    smaller number of participants, than to hold one review involving many.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to ensure required review tasks are appropriately planned&amp;nbsp;and organized, to ensure&#xD;
attendee's are invited and are adequately informed about the review, to facilitate the review so as to maximize the&#xD;
productivity of the reviewers and meet defined quality requirements, and to ensure that any actions identified for&#xD;
attention subsequent to the review are assigned and undertaken as agreed.</purpose>
