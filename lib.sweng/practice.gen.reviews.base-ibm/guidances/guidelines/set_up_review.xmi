    &lt;a id=&quot;Planning&quot; name=&quot;Planning&quot;>Planning&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We plan reviews to determine the focus and scope of the review, and to make sure all participants understand their&#xD;
    role, and the goals of the review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the review, define the scope of the review by determining the question that will be asked; define what will be&#xD;
    assessed and why? See the Checklist for the work products to be reviewed for the types of questions that could be&#xD;
    asked. The exact questions will depend on the phase in the project: earlier reviews will be concerned with broader&#xD;
    architectural issues, later reviews will be more specific.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the scope of the review has been determined, define the review participants, the agenda, the information that will&#xD;
    be required to perform the review. In selecting the participants, establish balance between software architecture&#xD;
    expertise and domain expertise. Clearly and unambiguously designate an assessment leader who will coordinate the&#xD;
    review. If necessary, draw upon other teams or other parts of the organization to supply domain or technical expertise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The number of reviewers should be approximately seven or less. If chosen appropriately, they will be more than capable&#xD;
    of identifying problems in the architecture. More reviewers actually reduce the quality of the review by making the&#xD;
    meetings longer, making participation more difficult, and by injecting side issues and discussion into the review.&#xD;
    Fewer than 4 reviewers increases the risk of review myopia, as the diversity of concerns is reduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers should be experienced in the area to be reviewed; for use cases, reviewers should have an understanding of&#xD;
    the problem domain; for software architecture a knowledge of software design techniques is also needed. Inexperienced&#xD;
    reviewers may learn something about the architecture by participating, but they will contribute little to the review&#xD;
    and their presence may be distracting. Keep the group small; no more than seven people and no fewer than three. Fewer&#xD;
    reviewers jeopardize the quality of the review, and more reviewers prevent interactive discussion essential to&#xD;
    achieving quality results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select reviewers appropriate for the material:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        those who have the background to understand the material presented&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        those who have an active stake in the quality of product or work product being reviewed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;PrepareReview&quot; name=&quot;PrepareReview&quot;>Preparation&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the review, the work products to be reviewed and any background material should be gathered and distributed to&#xD;
    the review participants. This must be done sufficiently in advance of the review meeting for reviewers to review the&#xD;
    material and gather issues. Distributing review materials sufficiently in advance, and allowing reviewers to have time&#xD;
    to prepare for the review significantly improves the quality of review results. Preparation for reviews also greatly&#xD;
    improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers should study the documentation, forming questions and identifying issues to discuss, &lt;b>prior to the&#xD;
    review&lt;/b>. Given normal workload of reviewers, a few working days is usually the minimum time needed to prepare for&#xD;
    the review.&#xD;
