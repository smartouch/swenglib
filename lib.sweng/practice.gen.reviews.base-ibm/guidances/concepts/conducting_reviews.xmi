    Make sure &lt;a id=&quot;UnderstandReviewerRoles&quot; name=&quot;UnderstandReviewerRoles&quot;>reviewers understand their&amp;nbsp;roles&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to conduct an effective review, everyone has a role to play. More specifically, there are certain roles that&#xD;
    must be played, and reviewers cannot switch roles easily. The basic roles in a review are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        review coordinator, who has the following sub roles:&lt;br />&#xD;
        -&amp;nbsp; moderator&lt;br />&#xD;
        -&amp;nbsp; recorder&lt;br />&#xD;
        -&amp;nbsp; responsible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reviewers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The moderator makes sure that the review follows its agenda and stays focused on the topic at hand. The moderator&#xD;
    ensures that side-discussions do not derail the review, and that all reviewers participate equally.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recorder is an often overlooked, but essential part of the review team. Keeping track of what was discussed and&#xD;
    documenting actions to be taken is a full-time task. Assigning this task to one of the reviewers essentially keeps them&#xD;
    out of the discussion. Worse yet, failing to document what was decided will likely lead to the issue coming up again in&#xD;
    the future. Make sure to have a recorder and make sure that this is the only role the person plays.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;responsible role&amp;nbsp;is the author of the work product under review. The presenter explains the work product&#xD;
    and any background information needed to understand it (although if the work product was not self-explanatory, it&#xD;
    probably needs some work). It's important that reviews not become &quot;trials&quot; - the focus should be on the work product,&#xD;
    not on the presenter. It is the moderator's role to make sure that participants (including the presenter) keep this in&#xD;
    mind. The presenter is there to kick-off the discussion, to answer questions and to offer clarification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers raise issues. It's important to keep focused on this, and not get drawn into side discussions of how to&#xD;
    address the issue. Focus on results, not the means.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Moderator&quot; name=&quot;Moderator&quot;>Have a moderator&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As discussed above, the moderator plays a crucial role in keeping the review from losing focus. It's important that the&#xD;
    moderator be focused on keeping the review on track; the moderator should not have reviewer responsibilities. The role&#xD;
    of the moderator is to elicit discussion, ensure equal participation, and to defuse contention. This is a full-time&#xD;
    task. Failure to moderate effectively causes reviews to drag on beyond their intended conclusion, and to fail to&#xD;
    achieve their goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;KeepReviewMeetingsBrief&quot; name=&quot;KeepReviewMeetingsBrief&quot;>Keep the review meetings brief&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are most effective when they are brief and focused on well-identified objectives. Because it is difficult to&#xD;
    maintain focus for long periods, and because reviewers have other work to do as well, limit reviews to no more than two&#xD;
    hours. If a review is expected to go longer, break it into several smaller and more focused reviews. Results will be&#xD;
    better if reviewers can maintain focus.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key to doing this is to have a well-identified agenda and clearly articulated goals. These should be communicated&#xD;
    when the review materials are distributed, and the moderator should reinforce them when the review meeting begins. The&#xD;
    moderator must then consistently (and sometime ruthlessly) reinforce these goals during the meeting.&#xD;
