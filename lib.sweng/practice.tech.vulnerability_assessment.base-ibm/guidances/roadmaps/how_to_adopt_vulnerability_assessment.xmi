  <mainDescription>&lt;p> This practice involves engaging the Development team (developers and QA specialists) &#xD;
  to perform basic vulnerability assessments during the implementation and pre-production &#xD;
  stages of the&amp;nbsp;software development life cycle&amp;nbsp;(SDLC). These assessments &#xD;
  are directed by the Security team and target key issues that the Development &#xD;
  team is able to understand and act on. More complex tests are still handled &#xD;
  by the Security team. This significantly alleviates the burden on the Security &#xD;
  team and reduces the cost of fixing security bugs, because the earlier an issue &#xD;
  is discovered, the less it costs to fix. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Using automated tools for Web application security testing is a key to this &#xD;
  practice. These tools enable someone with little knowledge of Web application &#xD;
  security testing to perform a vulnerability assessment. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> As mentioned earlier, to ensure that the vulnerability assessments performed &#xD;
  by the Development team are effective, they should be guided by the Security &#xD;
  team. It is the responsibility of the Security team to develop a security test &#xD;
  policy that describes how applications are to be tested and to develop tool &#xD;
  configuration templates. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> When adopting this model, it is best to engage the Development team gradually. &#xD;
  You could start by adding security testing to the functional, performance, and &#xD;
  usability testing that is already performed by the QA team. Then, at later stage, &#xD;
  developers could be equipped with tools and processes for performing security &#xD;
  assessments of the application components that they are working on. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> A successful adoption of this practice cannot occur without a Web application &#xD;
  security awareness program. Educating the Development team on common security &#xD;
  vulnerabilities and on principles for secure coding is essential for addressing &#xD;
  the Web application security challenge. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
