    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this context, a Test Policy describes the types of tests to perform to test a Web application for security&#xD;
    vulnerabilities. The types of tests included in a test policy depend on the vulnerability assessment objectives,&#xD;
    and on the role of the person performing the assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a Security Lead may decide to focus on addressing some key, high severity issues first. She will&#xD;
    then include in the test policy only tests for those types of issues. The user performing a vulnerability assessment&#xD;
    has to be able to act on the results (that is, he has to have that necessary skill set to address the discovered security&#xD;
    issues. A test policy for a security auditor should be comprehensive and include both infrastructure and application&#xD;
    tests). A test policy for developers should include only some key application tests that are easy for developers to&#xD;
    understand and address (for instance, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting).&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conducting a Web application vulnerability assessment is both a science and an art. The way you approach it will depend&#xD;
    on your objectives, your security test policy, and your skill level. There are many different tools and techniques that&#xD;
    can be employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automated security testing tools alleviate a lot of the tedious work involved in security testing. Also, automated&#xD;
    tools enable developers and QA specialists who are not security experts to perform vulnerability assessments of their&#xD;
    Web applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are using an automated tool, your first step will be to configure your security scan based on your test policy&#xD;
    and the characteristics of your test target. After running the scan, you will need to verify each finding and remove&#xD;
    false positives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Skilled security auditors may choose to perform additional manual tests, which were not covered by the automated&#xD;
    scanner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes, security testers face a challenge when communicating their findings to application owners and developers, because&#xD;
    their reports of vulnerabilities might be met with a degree of skepticism. In some cases, the security testers might&#xD;
    need to exploit certain key vulnerabilities, so that they can demonstrate the threat to the application stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Furthermore, during the process of exploiting identified security vulnerabilities, a security auditor could find&#xD;
    additional vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;
    decisions about what testing will be undertaken, and how the test effort will be conducted.&#xD;
