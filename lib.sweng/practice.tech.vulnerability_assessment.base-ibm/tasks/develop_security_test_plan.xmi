  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before you start your Web application vulnerability assessment, you need to build a test plan. Building a test plan&#xD;
    starts with establishing your test target. Depending on your assignment, a test target could consist of a range of IP&#xD;
    addresses, a set of Web applications, or a single Web application. If your target is an IP address range, this means&#xD;
    that you have to identify all of the Web properties in the given range first, and then test each of them for security&#xD;
    vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you establish your target, you need to select your test environment. A security test could potentially deface or&#xD;
    destabilize a Web application. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you test a Web application in a pre-production&#xD;
    environment. If you need to test a Web application that is already in production, you must use only tests that are&#xD;
    safe.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defining the test scope or the types of security tests that you will employ during your assessment depends on your&#xD;
    security test policy, your role, and the scope of your assignment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should also take into account any test restrictions. Perhaps you are testing in a production environment and, by&#xD;
    testing certain application functions, you run the risk of crashing the application. It is recommended that you speak&#xD;
    with the application owner and application developers to identify any potential risks and corresponding test&#xD;
    restrictions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All application stakeholders should agree on the date and time of the vulnerability assessment. This is necessary to&#xD;
    ensure that the test has minimal impact on any of the stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most applications have some sort of a mechanism for identifying and authorizing their users. You will need access&#xD;
    credentials to test an application that requires its users to log in. It is best to create a special account for the&#xD;
    purposes of the test. After the test is completed, you can simply delete the account, which will make &quot;cleaning up&quot; a&#xD;
    lot easier. If the application supports multiple user roles, you may need to obtain an account for each user role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conducting a security assessment may involve exploiting vulnerabilities to prove the risks associated with them. Also,&#xD;
    as mentioned previously, security testing may have side effects (for example, crashing the application, inserting garbage data into&#xD;
    the database, and so on). Therefore, it is important to obtain an approval from all stakeholders before you begin testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is recommended to obtain the contact information of key stakeholders who you may need to contact during your&#xD;
    assessment. For example, if the application crashes and you need to reboot the Web or application servers, you will&#xD;
    need to know who to contact.&#xD;
