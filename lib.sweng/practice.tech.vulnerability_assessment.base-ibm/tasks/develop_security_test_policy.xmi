  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this context, a Test Policy describes the types of tests to perform to test a Web application for security&#xD;
    vulnerabilities. The types of tests included in a test policy depend on the vulnerability assessment objectives,&#xD;
    and on the role of the person performing the assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a Security Lead may decide to focus on addressing some key, high severity issues first. She will&#xD;
    then include in the test policy only tests for those types of issues. The user performing a vulnerability assessment&#xD;
    has to be able to act on the results (that is, he has to have that necessary skill set to address the discovered security&#xD;
    issues. A test policy for a security auditor should be comprehensive and include both infrastructure and application&#xD;
    tests). A test policy for developers should include only some key application tests that are easy for developers to&#xD;
    understand and address (for instance, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting).&#xD;
