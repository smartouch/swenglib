  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some Web application vulnerabilities expose an organization to higher risk than others. It is important to evaluate the&#xD;
    risks associated with each vulnerability in order to prioritize their resolution. For example, a vulnerability that is&#xD;
    easy to discover and exploit (and would allow an attacker to steal sensitive user data or crash the application) should&#xD;
    be fixed before a vulnerability that is very difficult to discover, takes a very highly skilled attacker, and has a low&#xD;
    damage potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are different methodologies for evaluating the risks associated with security vulnerabilities. These&#xD;
    methodologies typically take into account factors such as ease of discovery, time to exploit, attacker skill level, and&#xD;
    so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you have evaluated the security risks, you should rank the vulnerabilities, and then create a list starting with&#xD;
    the highest priority ones on the top.&#xD;
