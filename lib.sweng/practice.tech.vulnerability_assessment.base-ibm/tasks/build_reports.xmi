  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task begins with identifying all of the stakeholders, and the type of information that each needs. For example, a Chief Security&#xD;
    Officer would be interested in knowing the security risk associated with the discovered vulnerabilities. A Compliance&#xD;
    Officer would be interested to know how the discovered security issues affect your organization's compliance with&#xD;
    particular government or industry standards. Developers would need to know the technical details about the discovered&#xD;
    vulnerabilities and, if possible, the steps they need to take to fix them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you have all of the reports ready, you should present them to the different stakeholders.&#xD;
