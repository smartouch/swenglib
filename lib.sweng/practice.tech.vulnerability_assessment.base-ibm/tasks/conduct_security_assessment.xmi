  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conducting a Web application vulnerability assessment is both a science and an art. The way you approach it will depend&#xD;
    on your objectives, your security test policy, and your skill level. There are many different tools and techniques that&#xD;
    can be employed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automated security testing tools alleviate a lot of the tedious work involved in security testing. Also, automated&#xD;
    tools enable developers and QA specialists who are not security experts to perform vulnerability assessments of their&#xD;
    Web applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are using an automated tool, your first step will be to configure your security scan based on your test policy&#xD;
    and the characteristics of your test target. After running the scan, you will need to verify each finding and remove&#xD;
    false positives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Skilled security auditors may choose to perform additional manual tests, which were not covered by the automated&#xD;
    scanner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes, security testers face a challenge when communicating their findings to application owners and developers, because&#xD;
    their reports of vulnerabilities might be met with a degree of skepticism. In some cases, the security testers might&#xD;
    need to exploit certain key vulnerabilities, so that they can demonstrate the threat to the application stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Furthermore, during the process of exploiting identified security vulnerabilities, a security auditor could find&#xD;
    additional vulnerabilities.&#xD;
