    A person acting in the Acquirer role needs to be, above all else, an expert in identifying and understanding problems&#xD;
    and opportunities. This includes the ability to articulate the needs that are associated with the key problem to be&#xD;
    solved or opportunity to be realized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    They use above-average communication skills and in-depth business knowledge aligned to business objectives, processes,&#xD;
    measurements and tools to analyze their stakeholder business needs and requirements, formulate hypotheses and test&#xD;
    conclusions to determine appropriate solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Knowledge of the business and technology domains are useful additional skills for those acting in this role. However,&#xD;
    these skills might be of less importance if the individual has the ability to absorb and understand new information&#xD;
    quickly. As a core role in the project team, a person playing this role must be able to collaborate effectively with&#xD;
    other team members.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A person acting in the Acquirer role must have a thorough understanding of the nature of the business problems in a&#xD;
    given industry, and the products and solutions that provide value in solving those problems and be knowledgeable in the&#xD;
    trends and directions of the industry, the marketplace, and the players.&#xD;
