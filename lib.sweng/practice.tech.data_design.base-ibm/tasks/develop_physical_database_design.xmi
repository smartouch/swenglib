  <mainDescription>&lt;p>
    This task outputs a physical database design which is represented as a physical data model. This model is the source
    from which the schema data definition language (DDL) code for direct physical implementation of the target database is
    created.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Typically an idealized design of the database is used as an input to this task. Primarily driven from a business
    context, this logical design is created without consideration for the target implementation environment. Progression to
    a physical design involves making adjustments to the model in order to account for various implementation
    considerations and performance requirements.
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Before introducing complexity into the database design for performance or other reasons, check if there is some
    flexibility in the requirements that could allow a simpler design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Consider using tools that generate DDL from the model, to save development time and to ensure the model is consistent
    with the implemented database.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>Create an implementation-specific database design that will provide adequate performance and ensure database integrity and
security.</purpose>
