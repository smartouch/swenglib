    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus is on refining the management information that constrains the solution. This information consists of cost,&#xD;
    schedule, scope and risk, as well as organizational policies and other organizational constraints. In addition, the&#xD;
    information regarding available contracting vehicles (e.g. license agreements) is refined, as well as the&#xD;
    organizational change readiness assessment and business process change management plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work in this sphere are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Update management information:&lt;/b> Monitor any changes to cost constraints, schedule constraints, scope, risks,&#xD;
        available skills and organizational policies that may affect the solution. Refine the requirements for training,&#xD;
        internal transfers or hiring if necessary.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Refine the organizational change readiness assessment:&lt;/b> The goal is to refine the organizational change&#xD;
        readiness assessment by continuing to collect data about the culture of the organization, updating points of&#xD;
        leverage to induce change, and learning more about the sources of resistance. The results of the assessment are&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are&#xD;
    assigned to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to&#xD;
    develop what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or even to develop things in parallel)&#xD;
    on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;

        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;

        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        In a world of rapidly changing products and punishing competition, mastering the management of business process&#xD;
        changes can be a key competency that distinguishes winners from losers. (Approximately 70% of business process&#xD;
        reengineering efforts, or redesigns, fail [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_cots-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_38304F32.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_1_bt0QiNEeCt4-FxrVeQpQ&quot;>KOC99&lt;/a>].) The adoption of a powerful concept, process, method, and/or tool often&#xD;
        holds the promise of dramatic benefits to an organization. Efforts to realize these benefits, however, often result&#xD;
        in frustration and anger from precisely those people who should benefit from the adoption. Business process change&#xD;
        management is, therefore, not an isolated task but a process that touches many of the socio-technical tasks at work&#xD;
        in an organization. A structured approach to managing the human elements is critical to achieving strategic&#xD;
        business objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        The quality and appropriateness of a new technical solution has been shown to be a poor predictor of the success of&#xD;
        a fielding in terms of the actual utilization of the new useful capabilities. A one-size-fits-all approach to&#xD;
        fielding and utilization of a solution seldom works. Successful fielding and utilization requires an appreciation&#xD;
        of the unique characteristics of each organization into which the technical solution will be fielded, and tasks to&#xD;
        support utilization will be tailored to fit those characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        Gaining predictable value from a new technology solution might require a number of people in the organization to do&#xD;
        their jobs differently. End-user business processes may change specifically to meet business objectives or they may&#xD;
        change to accommodate the business processes inherent in components under consideration within a technical&#xD;
        solution. An integral part of building and fielding a new technology solution requires anyone affected by the&#xD;
        solution to participate in defining and evaluating the solution so that they understand and support the tradeoffs&#xD;
        between business process changes required in various aspects of their jobs and an evolving understanding of the&#xD;
        capabilities of the components available &quot;off-the-shelf&quot;, the design of the architecture that links the components,&#xD;
        and the costs, schedule and risk of implementing the solution. This support must survive any turnovers and changes&#xD;
        in priorities, leadership, management, and reorganizations that occur in the organization from the time the change&#xD;
        is discovered to when it is fully implemented across the organization.&#xD;
