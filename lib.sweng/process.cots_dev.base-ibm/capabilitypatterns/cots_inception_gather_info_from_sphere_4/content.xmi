    The focus is on gathering the management information that must be captured and monitored to define the solution and&#xD;
    support futures tradeoffs. This information includes cost, schedule, scope and risk. Also included is any management&#xD;
    information such as policies or constraints from outside of this project that may affect the definition of the&#xD;
    solution. This information is originally based on information developed external to the project; subsequent iterations&#xD;
    are updated with project-specific information. In addition, available &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work in this sphere are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Identify management information:&lt;/b>&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify any cost constraints associated with the project and determine how much room exists for&#xD;
                negotiation.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify any schedule constraints for the project and understand what drives these constraints.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Capture the risks associated with the project and the impact or consequence of these risks.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify the team available for the project and determine its skills, capabilities, and possibility of&#xD;
                training, internal transfers or hiring if necessary.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identify and track any organizational policies that may apply to, or constrain, the solution.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Identify available&lt;/b> &lt;strong>contracting vehicles&lt;/strong>&lt;b>:&lt;/b> The goal is to identify and characterize&#xD;

        third-party vendors who provide tailoring or integration. Enterprise licenses are one example of contracting&#xD;
        vehicle; other parts of the organization may already have licenses that could be used for this solution.&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Perform an organizational change readiness assessment:&lt;/b> The goal is to perform an organizational change&#xD;
        readiness assessment by collecting data about the culture of the organization, identifying points of leverage to&#xD;
        induce change and identifying sources of resistance. This involves collecting information on the previous process&#xD;
        change history of the target organization. The types of information include the frequency and nature of technology&#xD;
        and changes to user's business process over the past 5-10 years, success or failure of the changes and the factors&#xD;
        that led to the outcome. The results of the assessment are captured in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are&#xD;
    assigned to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to&#xD;
    develop what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or even to develop things in parallel)&#xD;
    on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;

        Development tasks&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        In a world of rapidly changing products and punishing competition, mastering the management of business process&#xD;
        changes can be a key competency that distinguishes winners from losers. (Approximately 70% of business process&#xD;
        reengineering efforts, or redesigns, fail [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_cots-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_38304F32.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_1_bt0QiNEeCt4-FxrVeQpQ&quot;>KOC99&lt;/a>].) The adoption of a powerful concept, process, method, and/or tool often&#xD;
        holds the promise of dramatic benefits to an organization. Efforts to realize these benefits, however, often result&#xD;
        in frustration and anger from precisely those people who should benefit from the adoption. Business process change&#xD;
        management is, therefore, not an isolated task but a process that touches many of the socio-technical tasks at work&#xD;
        in an organization. A structured approach to managing the human elements is critical to achieving strategic&#xD;
        business objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        The quality and appropriateness of a new technical solution has been shown to be a poor predictor of the success of&#xD;
        a fielding in terms of the actual utilization of the new useful capabilities. A one-size-fits-all approach to&#xD;
        fielding and utilization of a solution seldom works. Successful fielding and utilization requires an appreciation&#xD;
        of the unique characteristics of each organization into which the technical solution will be fielded, and tasks to&#xD;
        support utilization will be tailored to fit those characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        Gaining predictable value from a new technology solution might require a number of people in the organization to do&#xD;
        their jobs differently. End-user business processes may change specifically to meet business objectives or they may&#xD;
        change to accommodate the business processes inherent in components under consideration within a technical&#xD;
        solution. An integral part of building and fielding a new technology solution requires anyone affected by the&#xD;
        solution to participate in defining and evaluating the solution so that they understand and support the tradeoffs&#xD;
        between business process changes required in various aspects of their jobs and an evolving understanding of the&#xD;
        capabilities of the components available &quot;off-the-shelf&quot;, the design of the architecture that links the components,&#xD;
        and the costs, schedule and risk of implementing the solution. This support must survive any turnovers and changes&#xD;
