    The construction phase prepares the solution for fielding. It includes the preparation of the support strategy and&#xD;
    necessary support materials. It also includes the preparation of the user business environment of the target&#xD;
    organizations to facilitate the initial fielding of the solution. Furthermore, it includes the creation of a deployment&#xD;
    unit that consists of the software solution and necessary accompanying artifacts required to effectively install and&#xD;
    test the solution. Indeed, we recommend performing some acceptance testing of the solution in the construction phase to&#xD;
    make sure the solution is ready for the initial rollout that will take place in the first iterations of the transition&#xD;
    phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work to prepare the solution for fielding are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop support strategy:&lt;/strong> The goal is to develop a support strategy for the solution. The&#xD;
        objective of the support strategy is to help the users attain proficiency in the solution and user business&#xD;
        processes that the solution supports, as well as making sure the users are motivated to use the solution and&#xD;
        self-supporting in their use of the solution. As an example, a support strategy could be based on a combination of&#xD;
        instructor-led and web-based training, just-in-time mentoring, help desk and technical support, as well as&#xD;
        mechanisms to encourage the solution adoption like reward, incentive, and compensation programs. Any support (such&#xD;
        as training) necessary for acceptance testing and for the initial rollout of the solution need to be provided to&#xD;
        the users. It may be useful to separate the support needed for initial introduction from the long-term support&#xD;
        strategy. It is also important to ensure that the affected stakeholders agree that the support strategy will meet&#xD;
        their needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop support materials:&lt;/strong> The materials that assist the user in learning, using, operating and&#xD;
        maintaining the solution need to be designed. The materials necessary for acceptance testing and for the initial&#xD;
        rollout of the solution need to be developed. Training is an important component of the support strategy. The&#xD;
        training strategy has to accommodate many different stakeholder roles. It may be useful to offer tailored training&#xD;
        to specific categories of stakeholders. You may consider customizing the vendor's standard training to the specific&#xD;
        user business processes of the target organizations, or provide additional training to complement the vendor's&#xD;
        standard training.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Prepare deployment unit:&lt;/strong> The purpose is to prepare a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/workproducts/deployment_packaging_6A94581B.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;mwebF181254E36F3BB6E8525688500522872&quot;>Deployment Packaging&lt;/a> that enables the solution to be effectively&#xD;
        installed, used, operated and maintained.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Implement needed changes to the user's business processes:&lt;/strong> As the production-quality release is&#xD;
        being assembled in the construction phase, the users must prepare to implement the changes to the user's business&#xD;
        processes associated with the solution. This is particularly true for the users involved in acceptance testing as&#xD;
        well as for those affected by the initial rollout of the solution that will take place in the first iterations of&#xD;
        the transition phase. This is done by implementing the appropriate elements of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.cots_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/cots_business_process_cm_plan_FA1A9D34.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_yylROewiEd-sjp03to1LnQ&quot;>Business Process Change Management Plan&lt;/a>. For instance, this involves&#xD;
        restructuring the organization as necessary and developing new policies and procedures to support the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Perform acceptance testing:&lt;/strong> Acceptance testing is the final test action before fielding the&#xD;
        solution. It can be performed with different levels of formality (&lt;strong>formal acceptance&lt;/strong>,&#xD;
        &lt;strong>informal acceptance&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>alpha test&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>beta test&lt;/strong>) depending on&#xD;
        organizational and corporate standards as well as application domains. The goal is to ensure that the solution is&#xD;
        deemed acceptable to the users prior to its general fielding. This is done by soliciting feedback on the solution&#xD;
        from a subset of the intended users while it is still under active development. The objective in the construction&#xD;
        phase is to verify that the executing system supports the needed changes to the user's business processes&#xD;
        associated with the solution, validate that the solution meets real needs and operates in an acceptable manner as&#xD;
        well as verify that the solution is ready for use by users: software solution integrated on the appropriate&#xD;
        platforms, current release described and changes to the user's business processes implemented. The goal is also to&#xD;
        make sure that existing defects and pending changes are not obstacles to achieving the purpose of the next&#xD;
        release.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
