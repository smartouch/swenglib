    In the elaboration phase, the focus remains twofold. One emphasis is on gaining a deeper understanding of the&#xD;
    architectural and design constraints imposed on the candidate solutions by any infrastructure on which the solution&#xD;
    will run and any other systems with which the solution must interact. The second focus is on refining any potential&#xD;
    architectural alternatives that may affect the candidate solutions in order to ensure that the implications are fully&#xD;
    understood.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be necessary to prototype critical external interfaces or design mechanisms that are new to the team. It may&#xD;
    also be necessary to prototype how the architecture responds to specific quality attributes such as reusability,&#xD;
    security, or scalability. Exploratory throwaway prototypes are used to mitigate specific risks in addition to the &lt;a&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_yylRKuwiEd-sjp03to1LnQ&quot;>Executing System&lt;/a> (called executable architectural prototype in elaboration) that is&#xD;
    built later in the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work in this sphere are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Refine the architectural context:&lt;/b> The purpose is to refine the architectural context for the solution in&#xD;
        sufficient detail to ensure that each candidate solution developed in response to the identified stakeholder needs&#xD;
        will operate in the context of the larger organization. This also involves refining architecture constraints,&#xD;
        boundaries and interfaces posed by external systems with which the solution must interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Refine architectural alternatives:&lt;/b> The purpose is to refine the potential architectural alternatives that&#xD;
        may affect the candidate solutions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
