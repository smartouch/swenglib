    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The emphasis is on monitoring changes to the business and stakeholder needs that could affect the solution being&#xD;
    fielded. The definition of needs for the solution should be extremely stable in the transition phase. However, slight&#xD;
    changes may be requested based on operational experiences with the solution. Feedback from operational experiences is&#xD;
    collected and may result in change requests (such as defects and enhancement requests) to be considered in the current&#xD;
    release or future releases. In addition, changes may be necessary to accommodate site-specific needs or if there are&#xD;
    significant COTS package changes during the phase. In these cases, it is important to maintain agreement with the&#xD;
    stakeholders and set realistic expectations on what changes will be made.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Creating business use cases&amp;nbsp;is very similar to creating system use cases. If you've never created business use&#xD;
    cases, you can leverage the skills of an analyst who has written use cases for software systems to help define the use&#xD;
    case model.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the boundary and interactions of the business by utilizing use cases to describe a &quot;black box&quot; view of the&#xD;
    business. Understand the organization at a high-level so that the initial scope of business definition or refactoring&#xD;
    can be determined.&amp;nbsp;Further analysis will be performed to detail these descriptions.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Changing a single behavior in the business can affect the structure of the business at a global level. New or changed&#xD;
    relationships and operations are often introduced when a specific behavior is defined within the business.&amp;nbsp;It's&#xD;
    possible for inappropriate relationships or undesirable operations to be introduced. These need to be corrected while&#xD;
    allowing the business to perform the desired behavior. It's likely that relationships need to be evaluated and refined&#xD;
    to accommodate the new behavior. For instance, multiplicity or the direction of the associations might need to be&#xD;
    adjusted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Operations also need to be normalized across the entire model. Look for operations that are redundant or entities that&#xD;
    have similar descriptions or purpose. Refactor operations and entities to reduce redundancy, and illegal or&#xD;
    contradictory behavior.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>A Business Analyst is an individual within an organization who defines, manages, or monitors Business Processes. They are&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Use Case Model is used by stakeholders and&amp;nbsp;business analysts to understand and improve the way the&#xD;
    business interacts with its environment, and by systems analysts and software architects to provide context for&#xD;
    software development. The project manager uses this artifact to plan the content of iterations during business modeling&#xD;
    and track progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to re-engineer the target organization, consider maintaining two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Use-Case Model: one that shows the business actors and business use cases of the current&#xD;
    organization (sometimes called &quot;as-is&quot;), and one that shows the target organization with new business actors and&#xD;
    business use cases (&quot;to-be&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are considering a significant redesign of the way the target organization works (business re-engineering), this&#xD;
    separation is needed otherwise the redesign will be developed without knowing&amp;nbsp; what the proposed changes really&#xD;
    are at the end, and you will not be able to estimate the effects or costs of those changes. It is like an architect who&#xD;
    is asked to draw up plans for changing a townhouse into three flats, without having an as-is blueprint from which to&#xD;
    work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of maintaining two Business Use-Case Models is not insignificant, and carefully consider how much effort you&#xD;
    put into a current model. Typically, you would not do more than identify and briefly describe the business use cases*&#xD;
    and business actors. You would also briefly outline the business use cases you determine are key to the effort,&#xD;
    possibly illustrating this with a simple activity diagram. The level of detail you choose aims at providing a shared&#xD;
    understanding of the target organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You would not need this separation in the following situations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no &quot;new&quot; organization (the goal is to document an existing organization)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no existing organization* (business creation)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business actors in the use-case model are used by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>business analysts&lt;/b>, to define the boundaries of the organization and describe the interactions between actors&#xD;
        and business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>user-interface designers&lt;/b>, as input to capturing characteristics on human actors in the a system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>system analysts&lt;/b>, as input to finding system actors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>*Note: when modeling an existing organization to create an as-is model, you need to do little more than create the&#xD;
    brief descriptions of business use cases, business actors and key business events and associate these with the existing&#xD;
    business goals because you can move more directly to capturing actual current business processes that realize these&#xD;
    business use cases. The current business use cases serve as anchors to explain the purpose of the current business&#xD;
    processes. When the purpose is business creation, the new business use cases are &lt;strong>specifications&lt;/strong> for&#xD;
    achievement of the business goals, for a business that does not yet exist. Consequently, they will need much more&#xD;
    detail.&lt;/em>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Use Case is an account of a pattern of use&amp;nbsp;in a business, and the effect that use has on the&#xD;
    environment (represented by business actors) and on the business itself. The pattern of use can change the way the&#xD;
    business responds to future events or interactions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Use Cases are useful for any organization that wants to know what value the business provides and how it&#xD;
    interacts with its environment. Stakeholders and&amp;nbsp;business analysts use Business Use Cases to describe business&#xD;
    processes and to understand the effect of any proposed changes (for example, a merger or a first CRM implementation) on&#xD;
    the way the business works. Business Use Cases are also used by system analysts and software architects to understand&#xD;
    the way a software system fits into the organization. Test managers use Business Use Cases to provide context for&#xD;
    developing test scenarios for software systems. Project managers use Business Use Cases for planning the content of&#xD;
    business-modeling iterations and tracking progress.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Use Case describes a business process from an external, value-added point of view. Business Use Cases are&#xD;
    business processes that cut across organization boundaries, possibly including partners and suppliers, in order to&#xD;
    provide value to a stakeholder of the business. A Business Use Case is a process-oriented specification of business&#xD;
    behavior in response to the following:&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs of all of the stakeholders are represented. In&#xD;
        particular, include the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system after it is&#xD;
        delivered.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide requirements and other requirements work&#xD;
        products. For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements within&#xD;
        system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or duplicated, and&#xD;
        that there is an agreed upon approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly&#xD;
        important when you separate externally mandated requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus&#xD;
        &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule impact, and level of contribution to business goals.&#xD;
        Based on your evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged, defended, and amended.&#xD;

    Actors represent different types of users. An actor is anyone or anything that exchanges data with the system. An actor&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The difference between an actor and an individual system user is that an actor represents a particular class of users,&#xD;
    rather than an actual user.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Several different individual users can play the same role, which means that they can be represented by the same, single&#xD;
    actor. In that case, each individual user constitutes an instance of the actor.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Points to consider when deciding whether to use a Component Model:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A Component Model is useful when you must design the system for multiple target environments, with separate design&#xD;
        architectures. The Component Model is an abstraction, or a generalization, of the system design. It omits most of&#xD;
        the details of the design in order to provide an overview of the system's functionality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Component Model provides value when the design is complex, such that new team members need a simplified,&#xD;
        abstracted model to understand it. A well-defined architecture can serve the same purpose.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Balance the extra work required to ensure that the component and design models remain consistent against the&#xD;
        benefit of having a view of the system that represents only the most important details of how the system works. It&#xD;
        can be very costly to maintain a high degree of fidelity between the Component Model and the system design. A less&#xD;
        ambitious approach might be to maintain the Component Model with only the most important components and the key&#xD;
        abstractions in the design. As the complexity of the Component Model increases, so does the cost to maintain it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Once you no longer maintain the Component Model, its value decays rapidly. At some point, it no longer accurately&#xD;
        reflects the current functional design of the system. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Model may be&#xD;
        appropriate, as it may have served its purpose, but the decision should be a conscious one.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many variants of the&#xD;
    system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure the successful development of a component model on a project, your team should:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a stable and coherent structure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Focus on the right levels of abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop relationship and interaction diagrams in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select architecturally significant requirements as inputs to the Component Model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plan how your team will leverage the Component Model throughout the project lifecycle&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The component model describes the structure of a system in terms of its software components with their&#xD;
    responsibilities, interfaces, relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required functionality. The&#xD;
    component model is the main artifact documenting the functional view of the architecture and serves as an abstraction&#xD;
    of the design. Components identified may be decomposed into further component models before they complete the&#xD;
    specification required for detailed design.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models help define and document:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The structure of the system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The recurring interactions and dependencies between sets of components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The components present within an enterprise, each of which may be made up of smaller components.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component models are documented at 2 levels:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The logical level - focuses on specifying the components' responsibilities and characteristics required to deliver&#xD;
        the requirements. These specifications are technology and product neutral.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The physical level -focuses on how to implement the components to meet the previously established specifications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may transform logical components into physical components via custom development, the purchase of products, or the&#xD;
    reuse of assets.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important to maintain a separation between logical and physical components on larger projects. However,&#xD;
    smaller or less complex projects may evolve a single logical component model into a physical model, and end up with&#xD;
    only a physical model.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of components at the logical level are a 'Message Bus' or a 'Customer Relationship Manager' component.&#xD;
    Components at the physical level that implement these logical components might be 'IBM WebSphere Message Broker' or&#xD;
    'Siebel Contact Center.'&lt;br />&#xD;

        accurately reflect the Executable Architecture. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Specification may be&#xD;
        appropriate (it may have served its purpose), but the decision should be a conscious one.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component Specifications tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many&#xD;
    variants of the system.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact specifies the details of a component identified in the Component Model. The specification shows the&#xD;
    interfaces offered and used by the component, identifies where business rules are placed, and details the operations&#xD;
    and their signatures for each interface.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Component Interfaces&lt;/strong> - An interface specifies one or more operation signatures and is both offered and&#xD;
    used by a component. Offering an interface means the component makes the interface available for other components to&#xD;
    use.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each interface provides a unique and well-defined set of operations. Hiding the structure of a&#xD;
    component and its data behind an interface allows that data to be changed without affecting how the interface is&#xD;
    used.&amp;nbsp; The actual composition of that data may change, but the interface that provides access to that data is&#xD;
    fixed. Interfaces also describe the state of a component.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Business Rules&lt;/strong> - Business Rules dictate the behavior of a system, and the component specification&#xD;
    defines how the system implements the business rules.&amp;nbsp; For example, a business rule may state that Internet&#xD;
    transactions for an on-line order can not exceed $1000 for a given account. A component that manages account&#xD;
    transactions may define an on-line transactions interface that implements this business rule.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Operations&lt;/strong> - Fully specified Component Specifications assign operations and operation signatures to&#xD;
    the interfaces and may define pre- and post-conditions on the operations.&amp;nbsp; Pre- and post-conditions specify the&#xD;
    effect of an operation without prescribing an algorithm or implementation.&amp;nbsp;A post-condition specifies the effect&#xD;
    of the operation on the components data or state.&amp;nbsp;A pre-condition is the condition under which the operation&#xD;
    guarantees that the post-condition is true.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some important considerations for making and implementing architectural decisions:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure the process for making decisions has the right level of sponsorship necessary to enforce those decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make architecturally significant decisions early and be sure to validate high risk decisions using an executable&#xD;
        architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review and update architectural decisions as development progresses and update this artifact so it reflects any&#xD;
        changes to your decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is not necessary to document every minute decision you make when developing the architecture; focus on those&#xD;
        that are controversial or are based on reasoning that is not obvious&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Levels of this artifact&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&amp;nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best&#xD;
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take&#xD;
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle&#xD;
    and the development techniques used.&amp;nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>logical&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>physical&lt;/strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,&#xD;
    iterative, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed&#xD;
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project &quot;milestone&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Varying depth of detail&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing&#xD;
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed&#xD;
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        This artifact may include the same &quot;recurring pattern&quot; of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate&#xD;
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Cross-cutting viewpoints&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact and the logical and physical levels of this artifact may be the focus of a particular viewpoint, at any&#xD;
    degree of elaboration and refinement, to address the concerns of a particular stakeholder. These cross-cutting&#xD;
    viewpoints overlap with one another.&amp;nbsp; For example, views may be constructed on this artifact for:&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well as a linkage via Deployment Units with the functional aspect of architecture as embodied in the Component&#xD;
    Model, this artifact has influences and/or is strongly interdependent on other areas that cover the design of the&#xD;
    infrastructure that will implement the operational aspect of architecture. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Network Design: affects the application design, middleware selection, component placement, security and privacy,&#xD;
        systems management and overall operational system control.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Platform Design; the detailed design and configuration of the platforms that will implement the nodes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Storage Design; the detailed design and configuration of storage which may be shared across multiple platforms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Site &amp;amp; Facilities Design; the detailed design and configuration of the site and facilities in the locations in&#xD;
        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what&#xD;
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&amp;nbsp; Selection of a systems management style&#xD;
        is an important decision, which determines: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of operations management&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The cost of software distribution&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The complexity of system management tooling&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Potential security and performance of the IT system (ability to satisfy the service level requirements)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Existing or planned enterprise-wide IT infrastructure initiatives on which the target system will be&#xD;
        implemented.&amp;nbsp; For example, enterprise wide middleware decisions may well move function, which would otherwise&#xD;
        be duplicated across multiple applications, into a set of shared services, which are usually purchased or part of&#xD;
        an enterprise wide development effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment&#xD;
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to&#xD;
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional&#xD;
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Operational Modeling Terminology&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3&#xD;
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actors (and workers) - the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Locations - a geographical area or position.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Borders - representing the existing connection between two locations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment Units - a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connectors - enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interactions - identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a&#xD;
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within&#xD;
        the target system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Zones - an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular&#xD;
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic&#xD;
        between two model elements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this&#xD;
    artifact.&amp;nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect&#xD;
        of the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology independent and product neutral&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Physical&lt;/strong>:&amp;nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of&#xD;
        the system architecture in a &lt;strong>technology and product dependent&lt;/strong> manner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the&#xD;
    level has been sized:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Unsized&lt;/strong> (or unranged) - the technology and products are specified to support the components&#xD;
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Ranged&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for&#xD;
        a defined range of circumstances.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Sized&lt;/strong> - the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and&#xD;
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are&#xD;
    assigned to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to&#xD;
    develop what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or even to develop things in parallel)&#xD;
    on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    work items.&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes and enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    This artifact describes how the project is organized, and identifies what practices will be followed. Additionally, it&#xD;
    defines the parameters for tracking project progress, and specifies the high-level objectives of the iterations and&#xD;
    their milestones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project plan allows stakeholders and other team members to understand the big picture and, roughly, when to expect&#xD;
    a certain level of functionality be available.&amp;nbsp;Update the plan&amp;nbsp;as often as necessary, usually at the end of&#xD;
    each iteration, in order to reflect changing priorities and needs, as well as record the lessons learned from the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>For a commercial software product, the Business Case should include a set of assumptions about the project and the order of&#xD;
magnitude return on investment (ROI) if those assumptions are true. For example, the ROI will be a magnitude of five if&#xD;
completed in one year, two if completed in two years, and a negative number after that. These assumptions are checked again&#xD;
at the end of the Elaboration phase, when the scope and plan are defined with more accuracy.</refinedDescription>

    The format and contents of the Project Measurements&amp;nbsp;depends on the metrics selected and the technology used for&#xD;
    collection and storage. It is essentially a database of metric-value associations and allied information for their&#xD;
    collection and calculation. Its form could be as simple as a set of files manually maintained by the Project&#xD;
    Manager.&amp;nbsp; However, we recommend that the collection and storage be automated and, as far as possible, be made&#xD;
    non-intrusive.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the objectives of the process is to ensure that the expectations of all parties are synchronized and consistent.&#xD;
    The periodic Status Assessment provides a mechanism for managing everyone's expectations throughout the project&#xD;
    lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuous open communication with objective data derived directly from ongoing activities and the evolving product&#xD;
    configurations are mandatory in any project. These project snapshots provide the basis for management's attention.&#xD;
    While the period may vary, the forcing function needs to capture the project history.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that Status Assessments are different from milestone reviews.&#xD;
