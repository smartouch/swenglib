    The transition phase focuses on fielding the solution to the user community and providing the necessary support. It&#xD;
    includes the development and implementation of a support strategy as well as the development of the necessary support&#xD;
    materials. It also includes the preparation of the user business environment of the target organizations to facilitate&#xD;
    the full fielding of the solution. Furthermore, it includes the creation of a deployment unit that consists of the&#xD;
    software solution and necessary accompanying artifacts required to effectively install, use, operate and maintain the&#xD;
    solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work to prepare the solution for fielding are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Develop and implement support strategy:&lt;/b> The goal is to develop and implement the support strategy for the&#xD;
        solution. The objective of the support strategy is to help the users attain proficiency in the solution and user&#xD;
        business processes that the solution supports, as well as making sure the users are motivated to use the solution&#xD;
        and self-supporting in their use of the solution. As an example, a support strategy could be based on a combination&#xD;
        of instructor-led and web-based training, just-in-time mentoring, help desk and technical support, as well as&#xD;
        mechanisms to encourage the solution adoption like reward, incentive, and compensation programs. It may be useful&#xD;
        to separate the support needed for initial introduction from the long-term support strategy. For instance, the&#xD;
        long-term support strategy may include several maintenance releases. These maintenance releases can be in response&#xD;
        to latent errors in the solution that may require an immediate fix, to the need for enhancements and more routine&#xD;
        bug fixes that can be accommodated in more routine or periodic releases, or to incorporate COTS package patches and&#xD;
        new COTS package releases. Each maintenance release requires one or more iterations depending on the number and&#xD;
        complexity of defects to be fixed and enhancements to be made. It is also important to ensure that the affected&#xD;
        stakeholders agree that the short and long-term support strategies will meet their needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Develop support materials:&lt;/b> The materials that assist the user in learning, using, operating and maintaining&#xD;
        the solution need to be developed. Training is an important component of the support strategy. The training&#xD;
        strategy has to accommodate many different stakeholder roles. It may be useful to offer tailored training to&#xD;
        specific categories of stakeholders. You may consider customizing the vendor's standard training to the specific&#xD;
        user business processes of the target organizations, or provide additional training to complement the vendor's&#xD;
        standard training.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Prepare deployment unit:&lt;/b> The purpose is to prepare a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/workproducts/deployment_packaging_6A94581B.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;mwebF181254E36F3BB6E8525688500522872&quot;>Deployment Unit&lt;/a> that enables the solution to be effectively&#xD;
        installed, used, operated and maintained.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Implement needed changes to the user's business processes:&lt;/b> The users must implement the changes to the&#xD;
        user's business processes associated with the solution release. This is done by implementing the appropriate&#xD;
        elements of the Business Process Change Management Plan. For instance, this involves restructuring the organization&#xD;
        as necessary and developing new policies and procedures to support the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Perform acceptance testing:&lt;/b> Acceptance testing is the final test action before fielding the solution. It can&#xD;
        be performed with different levels of formality &lt;strong>(formal acceptance&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>informal&#xD;
        acceptance&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>alpha test&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>beta test&lt;/strong>) depending on organizational and&#xD;
        corporate standards as well as application domains. The goal is to ensure that the solution is deemed acceptable to&#xD;
        the users prior to fielding. The objective in the transition phase is to verify that the solution is ready for use&#xD;
        by users: software solution integrated on the appropriate platforms, current release described and intended fixes&#xD;
        and enhancements operate as expected and that associated changes to the user's business processes are acceptable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
