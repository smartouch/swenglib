    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are assigned

    to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to develop

    what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or

    even to develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be
    solved during the iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess
    at the end if those objectives have been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references
    those work items.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate results and actions from
    assessments.

    This list should capture the critical and serious risks. If you find this list extending beyond 20 items, carefully consider

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        System-wide requirements
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Changes and enhancement requests
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Defects
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Development tasks
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    A change request (CR) is typically a proposed variance from the system's current (or currently planned)&#xD;

    &lt;b>Enhancement Requests&lt;/b>&#xD;
