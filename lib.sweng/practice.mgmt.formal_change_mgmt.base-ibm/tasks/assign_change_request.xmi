  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task assigns a change request to a resolver for implementation. Work is assigned, estimated, and tracked.&#xD;
    When the task is complete, it is set to Resolved, as with any other work item.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the purposes of this task, &lt;i>resources&lt;/i> refer to the people who might carry out the task, and not to any equipment that&#xD;
    might be required for the task.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine if there other similar or related tasks that need to be considered. Consider what resources you have available.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there are other similar or related tasks that need to be considered for planning purposes for&#xD;
        the target iteration (for example, you can't implement one without the other)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What resources do you have available, and who is the best resource for the task?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is the level of effort understood and agreed to?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What iteration does the change request need to be associated with?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who should be working on which tasks and when?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do you have the correct number of resources with the correct skill set to accomplish the scope of work that your project&#xD;
        requires?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are you expecting a resource to work on a task at a time when that resource will not be available to work (for&#xD;
        example, when the resource will be on vacation)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have you assigned a resource to so many tasks that you have exceeded the capacity of the resource to work? Is the&#xD;
        resource over-allocated?&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
         &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this task is to assign a change request to an individual for implementation in a specified&#xD;
    iteration. This task is performed as part of the iteration planning.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
