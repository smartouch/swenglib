  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Change management is the process of planning and coordinating the implementation of product changes in a planned,&#xD;
    authorized, logical, and orderly fashion. It does not develop changes, nor does it implement them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Relationship to work item management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most of the work in a project can be planned, assigned, and tracked by a project manager in collaboration with the&#xD;
    team. This practice is not about assignments within the team, but rather about identifying particular types of changes&#xD;
    and work products that require approvals by specific stakeholders, typically from outside the development team. Since&#xD;
    these change requests are assigned and implemented, they are work items, but we call them out separately to emphasize&#xD;
    that there is a separate enhanced process for managing them.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <additionalInfo>For more information on this practice,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see the &lt;a&#xD;
href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/practices/formal_change_mgmt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>practice resource&#xD;
page&amp;nbsp;on IBM&amp;reg; developerWorks&amp;reg;&lt;/a>.</additionalInfo>
  <problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice is an explicit approach for controlling changes, including defining states for the change request&#xD;
    artifact and tasks for transitioning the change request artifact between states. This practice is useful in a number of&#xD;
    situations, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When there is a group of stakeholders outside the project team that needs to approve and verify certain kinds of&#xD;
        changes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When a baselined work product is part of a contract in which changes need to be strictly controlled and approved&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When changes need to be tightly controlled (such as late in an iteration or release cycle) for stabilization&#xD;
        purposes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Risks of not having a change management practice&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without a change management practice, an organization risks encountering the following problems:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Difficulties in tracking changes (status of the change, which changes were entered into which release, and so on).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Delays in resolving issues and deploying changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Duplicate effort or lost change requests.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requests that are not prioritized according to stakeholder needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hard to establish mechanism for measurement and improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduced quality of products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Higher costs to introduce changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Reasons not to have a change management practice&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every organization and project should have a change management practice. However, there are some special cases in which&#xD;
    you may not implement a change management practice. These cases are mainly related to cost and time constraints, such&#xD;
    as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A one-time project with tight schedules&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A very small project that has some procedures already adopted&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Distributed teams, with each team already using a different practice, and the project timeline does not permit the&#xD;
        introduction of a unified practice&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></problem>
  <goals>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure that all proposed changes are documented prior to installation in the production environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure verification of technical completeness:&lt;br />&#xD;
        • Accuracy of technical impact and risk analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
        • Plans for final test and installation&lt;br />&#xD;
        • Identification and review of all technical dependencies, including the effect on concurrent changes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure that the timing of product change executions does not conflict with the business plans and priorities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure appropriate management involvement and approval, such as:&lt;br />&#xD;
        • Required sign-offs (for example, justification, user acceptance, affected areas)&lt;br />&#xD;
        • Approval, deferral, or disapproval of change installations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure that successful testing is verified to the degree required by organization standards before&#xD;
        introducing the change to the production environment (customer deliverables)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure the documentation of actual change installations, enable communication of the change results, provide a&#xD;
        history of changes, and support the maintenance of systems documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To minimize the adverse impact of necessary changes on system integrity, security, and the service-level&#xD;
        agreements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To allow the coordination and planning of changes in order to provide a stable production environment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To maximize the productivity of persons involved in the planning, coordination, and implementation of &quot;quality&quot;&#xD;
        changes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></goals>
  <application>The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure, what it is in it, and how&#xD;
it is organized.</application>
