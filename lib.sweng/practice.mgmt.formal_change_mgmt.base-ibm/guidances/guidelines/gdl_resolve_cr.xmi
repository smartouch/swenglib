    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Resolving a change request is the process of recording that the development activity has been completed and unit&#xD;
    tested for the change request, and that the associated change sets are ready for formal testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The action of resolving the change request is typically performed by the person to whom the change request has been&#xD;
    assigned.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Verify artifacts associated with the change request&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the properties of the change request to ensure that all of the relevant change sets are associated with the change&#xD;
    request.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The details of this step will depend upon the configuration and change management system that you are using. However, it&#xD;
    is important to maintain traceability between the change request, associated change sets, and ultimately the new&#xD;
    versions of each artifact changed to realize each change set. This information will greatly simplify verification&#xD;
    (for example, by informing testers what has changed to resolve the change request so that they can ensure appropriate&#xD;
    test coverage). It will also simplify repair and re-work should problems be identified during&#xD;
    testing. Finally, this information permits any destabilizing changes to be identified and potentially backed-out&#xD;
    of the configuration to undo the change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Disposition change request&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Update the relevant attributes of the change request. Again, the details of this step will depend on the&#xD;
    configuration and change management system being used, and the specific attributed defined. For example, you may&#xD;
    track effort to provide management metrics. In this case, you should provide an estimate of how much time was required&#xD;
    to resolve the change request.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally, transition the change request to the Resolved state.&#xD;
