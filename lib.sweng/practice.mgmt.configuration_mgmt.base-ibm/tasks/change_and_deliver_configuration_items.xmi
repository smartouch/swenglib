    It is an essential part of any CM system to ensure that work products are under version control, and that team members&#xD;
    have access to approved baselines. The idea of updating views to ensure access to the most recent collective body of&#xD;
    work is obvious. This should occur on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each team member having updated a view, can work on any work product through the standard process of 'check-out, edit,&#xD;
    build, unit test, and check-in' as described in further steps.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    Check-In and Check-Out are the operations that enable development staff to obtain a particular version of a work&#xD;
    product, make changes to it, and re-submit it to become the latest controlled version.&#xD;

    Prepare for Delivery Changes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivery addresses the notion of integration of work from streams of implementers. Delivery is an important step that&#xD;
    implies that a developer considers his work to be of sufficiently high quality to be incorporated into the overall&#xD;
    product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All files are checked-in prior to delivery. This avoids the situation of having orphaned files that are not included in&#xD;
    a build and might be needed for subsequent updates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The developers build and test their work in their development areas against the work included in the most recent stable&#xD;
    baselines before they deliver to the integration workspace. This minimizes the amount of merging that developers must&#xD;
    do when they perform deliver operations.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deliver Changes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The developer is required to merge his/her changes with those made by other developers. This is typically done in a&#xD;
    private integration workspace, so that the merged changes may be tested prior to final delivery to the project&#xD;
    integration workspace. The delivery is complete when all merge changes have been checked-in and delivered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br /></sectionDescription>

    To ensure that developers follow 'check-in and check-out' procedures to make changes to version controlled work&#xD;
    products and delivering changes from a development workspace to the integration workspace.&#xD;
