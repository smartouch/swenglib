    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are &lt;em>very&lt;/em> expensive to perform but, when performed well,&amp;nbsp;are highly valuable. It is crucial that&#xD;
    they be performed effectively. Identified issues should be solved outside of the meeting. Subsequent reviews need only&#xD;
    go over the action lists from the meeting to ensure each issue has been appropriately addressed. This means that action&#xD;
    lists are essential artifacts for effective reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is crucial to understand that reviews are not a replacement for good modeling in the first place. One of the basic&#xD;
    requirements prior to a review is that the model &lt;em>executes properly&lt;/em>. In a PIM review, this means that it is&#xD;
    debugged and can replicate (via execution) the use case scenarios. In a PSM review, this means that the model has&#xD;
    passed formal unit testing. You should NEVER find a compilation problem in a review; it is far cheaper to have the&#xD;
    product owner find that on their own &lt;em>prior to planning the review&lt;/em> rather than find it in a room full of&#xD;
    people. The intent of the review should be to evaluate an set of already high-quality artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is also very important to &lt;em>stay focused&lt;/em> during the review. The meeting leader needs to rule with a (silk&#xD;
    covered) iron fist. Reviews are very expensive so the object is to perform the intent of the review as efficiently as&#xD;
    possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Note: subsequent reviews of an already-reviewed work product should focus exclusively on the action list from the&#xD;
    previous review.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are a number of work products created in a modern software-centric development project. Any of them may be&#xD;
    subject to a review, depending on the delivery process in which they are created. Some of these include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements specification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems engineering models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software or hardware design models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software source code&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test cases, procedures, and results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Plans: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Software Development Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Quality Assurance Plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Software Verification Plan&#xD;

            &lt;li>&#xD;

        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to inject quality into work products is through careful engineering and demonstration and test via&#xD;
    execution or simulation. For many of these work products, execution isnâ€™t feasible, so reviews are a way of assessing&#xD;
    the quality of the work product. In addition, many work products must conform to guidelines, standards or templates and&#xD;
    this is most easily demonstrated through a review process. Lastly, reviews also serve to disseminate information to&#xD;
    different stakeholders about the structure, content, and quality of a work product.&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A change request (CR) is typically a proposed variance from the system's current (or currently planned) behavior. It&#xD;
    can also be used for a generic piece of work that is required to support the project. Change requests may include&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A report of an error (defect)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        An enhancement request&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Change requests provide a record of decisions and, with an appropriate assessment process, ensures that their change&#xD;
    impacts are considered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some important types of change requests include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Enhancement Requests&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Used by various stakeholders to request future features that they desire to have included in the product. These are a&#xD;
    type of stakeholder request that capture and articulate an understanding of the stakeholders needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Defects&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reports of anomalies or failures in a delivered work product. Defects include such things as omissions and&#xD;
    imperfections found during early lifecycle phases, or symptoms of faults (failures) that need to be isolated and&#xD;
    corrected within the software. Defects may also include deviations from what can reasonably be expected of the software&#xD;
    behavior (such as usability issues).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of a defect is to communicate the details of the issue, enabling corrective action, resolution, and&#xD;
    tracking to occur.&#xD;
