  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the asset is made visible to a target audience that goes beyond the Repository. As part of the normal&#xD;
    asset review activities, the asset may transition to the state of Approved. It is then&amp;nbsp;visible to the Asset&#xD;
    Consumers with the appropriate access control.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, here&amp;nbsp;you are interested in making the asset visible to other target audiences. This task will largely&#xD;
    take place as certain asset types, such as Service Interfaces, are published into service registries.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this case the Service Interface likely has several key artifacts such as the WSDL,&amp;nbsp;and XSDs. At this point, the&#xD;
    approved Service Interface asset is selected and the target service registry is identified. The contents of the Service&#xD;
    Interface (or whatever asset type it may be) asset are published to the service registry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This can affect the state of the asset in the Repository by&amp;nbsp;transitioning to something such as &quot;published&quot;.&#xD;
    Publishing the asset introduces some issues around classification and security. The classification of the asset in the&#xD;
    Repository may not map directly to the classification that is available in the target repository or registry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another consideration is security and access control. In some cases the access control between the two systems may be&#xD;
    dissimilar. It is critical that one Repository does not betray the access control specified in another repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A development-time repository is focused on the governance of assets to aid the development organization. The runtime&#xD;
    service registry is focused on the governance of services into and out of production environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 638px; HEIGHT: 343px&quot; height=&quot;550&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;The contents of the Service Interface asset are published to the service registry.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/image14.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;322&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>When publishing an asset to another repository or registry, the administrators will also need to deal with duplicated&#xD;
data and how to handle updates and new versions. It is also necessary to consider which system is the source of record for&#xD;
the asset or some portion of the asset.</mainDescription>
