  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many kinds of metrics to track. Some metrics are tracked by the Repository, others are tracked by other tools&#xD;
    or roles. These metrics can come from various sources, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset Consumers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset Owners/Producers/Reviewers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Repository&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Derived for Managers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Asset Consumer metrics generally include qualitative metrics, such as reusability ratings (4 out of 5 stars) or text&#xD;
    feedback in the form of comments and discussions. Typically these metrics are stored on the Repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Asset Owners/Producers/Reviewers tend to create asset-level metrics. These include metrics such as anticipated level of&#xD;
    effort for an Asset Consumer to use the asset, and the level of effort to create a given version of an asset. The&#xD;
    metrics also include size, such as number of bytes, lines of code, or number of components. Typically these metrics are&#xD;
    stored with the asset in the Repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Repository metrics are largely quantitative. These include metrics such as number of downloads for a given asset&#xD;
    version, number of searches and kinds of searches, number of browses from searches, as well as information on which&#xD;
    Asset Consumers conducted certain downloads. Some of the other metrics may be repository activity over a period of&#xD;
    time, such as, number of repository accesses, or asset submissions and so forth over a period of time. The Repository&#xD;
    can also track number of problems or defects associated with an asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, Repositories are not tracking the cost side of asset development. This is typically tracked in project&#xD;
    management and financial reporting tools. Bringing together the metrics from Asset Consumers, Asset&#xD;
    Owners/Producers/Reviewers and the Repository with costing metrics gives a foundation for derived metrics. Some of&#xD;
    these metrics include project reuse percentage, project productivity gains, and return on investment.&#xD;

    Reports may be generated graphically or textually. The metrics may be exported from the Repository into reporting&#xD;
    tools, or the Repository may render the reports.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managers often requires reports on a periodic basis, which generally means Repositories need a way to run reporting&#xD;
    jobs and send them to the appropriate stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Repositories should be integrated with portfolio and project management tools to aid the generation of derived metrics.&#xD;
