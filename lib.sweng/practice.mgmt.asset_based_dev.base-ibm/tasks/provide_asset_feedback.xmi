  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several forms of asset feedback. Some are quantitative, and some are qualitative. To offer feedback, the&#xD;
    asset is generally selected first in the Repository and then the feedback is given. In general you don't have to use&#xD;
    the asset in order to give feedback, but it certainly influences the quality of the feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some forms of feedback include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rating system: this is a well-known form of feedback where stars or some other icon is used; it is great for quick&#xD;
        glances but lacks the descriptive power of other forms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Comments: this is providing textual description of experiences with an asset, and is generally given in a single&#xD;
        direction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discussions: discussion threads or forums provide a community approach to addressing feedback.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Problems or Issues: this is more formal feedback where a problem number may be retrieved and the asset development&#xD;
        team tracks the submitted issue and responds with future releases of the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Surveys: these are&amp;nbsp;sent to the Asset Consumer asking them to fill out the questions and reply.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In general, the feedback should be captured in the Repository, where you can track&amp;nbsp;the relationship of the feedback to&#xD;
assets, Asset Consumers, feedback providers, and so forth. If a Problem or Issue is submitted, then these relationships are&#xD;
even more important as the asset owners, producers, and other teams involved with authoring the asset plan are notified of&#xD;
the problem and create plans for addressing the issue.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To deliver insight and the effects of using the asset back to the asset owners or to benefit other potential Asset&#xD;
        Consumers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To have a channel for communicating to repository administrators any issues with the repository.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
