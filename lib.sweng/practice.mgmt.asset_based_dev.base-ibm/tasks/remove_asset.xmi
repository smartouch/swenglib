  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three levels of removing an asset from a repository. These include retiring an asset, archiving an asset, and&#xD;
    deleting an asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Retire Asset&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is performed by an administrator who sets the state of the asset to retired. The effect of this is the asset is no&#xD;
    longer visible to the Asset Consumers, but is still visible to the Asset Owner and the administrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Archive Asset&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is performed by an administrator who sets the state of the asset to archived. The effect of this is the asset is&#xD;
    no longer visible to Asset Consumers or to the Asset Owner, but is still visible to the administrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Delete Asset&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is performed by the Asset Owner or the administrator. The effect of this is the asset is removed from the&#xD;
    Repository. Certainly this needs to be handled with care.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Considerations for removing an asset&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some of the considerations for removing an asset are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset usage levels: the asset is dormant, few searches, few browses, few downloads, little feedback, and so forth.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Funding termination: sponsor changes or terminates funding support, perhaps due to business prioritization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Need for solution diminishes: the problem either goes away, or a new solution is available, or level of effort to&#xD;
        maintain become prohibitive.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An impact analysis should be conducted where current Asset Consumers are evaluated and the impact to their projects is&#xD;
    understood.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The impact analysis should also address asset relationships, including the related assets' Asset Owners/Producers, as&#xD;
    well as other technical dependencies. The Asset Owners/Producers of related assets may need to participate in the&#xD;
    planning depending on the nature of the problem and the nature of the asset relationship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The administrator and Asset Owner should communicate with&amp;nbsp;the Managers&amp;nbsp;to understand the business impact to&#xD;
    removing the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A case should be prepared to determine the level of removing the asset. Enough insight should be collected to answer&#xD;
    the question: Should the asset be retired, archived, or deleted?&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most cases the enterprise should avoid deleting the asset from the repository. To be more specific, assets which&#xD;
    have just been submitted to the repository and are in the initial state or draft state, or rather, the asset has not&#xD;
    gone through review and approval processes and are not available for asset consumers, are generally&amp;nbsp;OK to delete&#xD;
    from the repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Asset owners can generally delete non-approved assets with little repercussion. Whereas assets which have been approved&#xD;
    and are being reused are more difficult to delete. One of the more challenging aspects to removing assets is ensuring&#xD;
    that the entire set of Asset Consumers are communicated with. Having support from the repository to automate much of&#xD;
    this communication is a critical feature.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
