  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing a reusable asset generally requires additional effort and cost to the organization. The effort, and&#xD;
    therefore its associated cost, is expended in preparing the asset's artifacts, creating supporting packaging material,&#xD;
    such as documentation and guidance for the Asset Consumer, submitting the asset and preparing the metadata, and&#xD;
    conducting reviews and approvals of the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, it becomes necessary to govern the asset creation process. A critical step in this governance is to&#xD;
    understand what the recurring problems are&amp;nbsp;that will justify the costs for developing a reusable asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As asset ideas come forward, the organization should conduct recurring problem analysis to justify the development and&#xD;
    long-term maintenance of the asset. This analysis may vary in rigor and formality depending on the nature and type of&#xD;
    the proposed reusable asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a proposed asset to provide sorting of values in a list may likely have the recurring problem analysis&#xD;
    handled informally amongst a development team or perhaps across several teams. In contrast,&amp;nbsp;a tax calculation&#xD;
    service will likely require more formal coordination and verification of the problem, its context and the proposed&#xD;
    solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To understand the problem, the asset producer needs to understand the impact of the problem on the users. When defining&#xD;
    the problem, define the context within which the problem exists. Explain the context in business terms and in technical&#xD;
    terms. Also, verify the problem and its context exist in multiple places.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The temptation is to focus on describing the solution before having a solid definition of the problem. Fight this&#xD;
    tendency and don't spend significant time on this step until step 1 is completed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The proposed solution should be relevant to the problem's context and assumptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A rule of thumb from the patterns community is the problem/solution combination should be verifiable in three places in&#xD;
    order for it to be a candidate for a pattern. While this is not being strictly prescribed here, it is a very reasonable&#xD;
    guideline to follow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is critical to evaluate the combination of the problem and the solution. In some contexts the solution to the same&#xD;
    problem may vary slightly. It is possible to have multiple implementations, or solutions, to the same problem. The&#xD;
    variance is caused by changing contexts, target Asset Consumers and delivery channels for the assets.&#xD;
