  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This team creates and uses Asset Specifications to create and maintain assets. The intended scope of the team should be&#xD;
    defined. Will the team be responsible for creating assets for the declared reuse scope at the enterprise level or the&#xD;
    divisional level? Will the team create the assets, or is the purpose of the team to clean up assets and prepare them&#xD;
    for reuse?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Directly associated with the scope of the Asset Manufacturing Teams is the manufacturing process. There are several&#xD;
    models to consider. These models use the basic producer and consumer model for assets. The premise is that an&#xD;
    organization is focused on the creation of assets and another organization is focused on the usage of assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In more mature organizations, the assets having a wider scope and impact are developed by special teams as part of an&#xD;
    Asset Manufacturing Center or Excellence Center. This role captures the responsibilities and the tasks performed by&#xD;
    these development groups with regard to the asset production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The image below describes such an organization which has a clean split between the asset production and the asset&#xD;
    consumption aspects of its development practices:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
