  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset specification describes the asset being proposed. The specification should provide technical justification&#xD;
    for the asset. Not all assets will require an asset specification. In general assets which will require or it is&#xD;
    expected to require a meaningful investment for the organization, or of sufficient complexity or reuse scope as to&#xD;
    require multiple teams will benefit from creating an asset specification. The asset specification may go through&#xD;
    several iterations as greater understanding of the problem and the solution are gathered from stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The need for this asset has generally been established, and sometimes sponsorship and support for the asset has been&#xD;
    secured. This specification can be used by the support teams to understand the asset. It also certainly can and should&#xD;
    be used by the asset owner or producer to create and update the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This specification is largely intended for technical teams to use, although it can be shared with sponsors and&#xD;
    technical management as part of making decisions to fund and staff the effort to build, maintain, and support the&#xD;
    asset. The specification should include the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify items such as the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset name.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The problem the asset is expected to solve.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Description of the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Expected context(s).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Expected artifacts in the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset relationships and dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Possible categorization/classification: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Business.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Technical.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Organizational.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Expected asset consumer skills.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How the expected asset consumer will use the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset owner and maintainer - sponsor and funding.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimated asset development effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimated asset consumer benefits.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <representationOptions>The degree of formality for asset specification is affected by the kinds of assets which will be produced and their&#xD;
complexity. Certainly simple assets which contains a presentation or document only will likely have a different level of&#xD;
specification compared to a service asset which includes models, test data, a service interface and implementation.</representationOptions>
