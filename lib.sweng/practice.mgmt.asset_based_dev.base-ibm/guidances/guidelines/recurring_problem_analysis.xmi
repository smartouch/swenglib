  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analyzing and structuring software problems is a task that is often given little formal structure and attention. In the&#xD;
    face of external pressures such as competitive pressures, time-to-market pressures, and so forth, the development&#xD;
    organization may short cut this effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, it is understood by most that the nature of the problem must be understood before the proper solution is&#xD;
    established. And yet getting time on the project schedule to have a formal description of the problem and to verify its&#xD;
    existence and the existence of the solution is a difficult task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before that can be overcome the enterprise needs some formalism for describing problems that can be understood at&#xD;
    multiple levels. To help with this the enterprise should establish artifacts and models that will be used to describe&#xD;
    the problem and the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This can include using context diagrams, scenario diagrams, and object diagrams. With these kinds of models and&#xD;
    diagrams the architect or developer is often prone to generalize the problem or the context too soon.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The method for arriving at the real nature of the problem is to continue to ask ‘why'. The architect or developer [or&#xD;
    other asset producer] should continue to drill into the real issue through a succession of ‘why' questions in an&#xD;
    attempt to go beyond a description of the features and tease out the relevant issues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As this is performed, the Asset Specification is updated to reflect the description of the recurring problem and the&#xD;
    proposed solution for this.&#xD;
