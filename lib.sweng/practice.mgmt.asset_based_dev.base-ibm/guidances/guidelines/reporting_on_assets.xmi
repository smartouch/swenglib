  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tooling should automate much of the reporting of asset activities and metrics. The repositories typically track&#xD;
    activity-level metrics, meaning the number of retrievals and searches, updates, and so forth. This is useful, but&#xD;
    doesn't address the cost side of assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the business to understand the benefits of assets the activity metrics and the cost metrics need to be brought&#xD;
    together to understand the potential value of the assets. This is typically done in the context of a project, or may be&#xD;
    rolled up to the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, if the enterprise wants to know the value of using asset X on project Y, the enterprise needs to enforce&#xD;
    the collection of asset consumer experiences in using the assets. This includes capturing information such as &quot;hours to&#xD;
    use the asset&quot;, &quot;hours saved using the asset&quot;, and then combining that with cost metrics for the resources involved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even with this level of capturing metrics and reporting, there is still much that is subjective&amp;nbsp;or&#xD;
    simple&amp;nbsp;estimations, which negatively impacts the quality of the numbers being reported.&#xD;
