  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To publish an asset means making it visible to the target audience in a target repository. This requires coordination&#xD;
    of asset content and metadata.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Publishing an asset to another repository provides a cross community view of the asset. To do this requires federating&#xD;
    metadata and content across the repositories. In some cases this is achieved by physically replicating information&#xD;
    while in other cases links are used that users can navigate from one repository to the other. For any artifact that is&#xD;
    replicated between the repositories, it is important to establish which repository owns the &quot;master copy&quot; and which&#xD;
    holds a &quot;cached copy&quot; of the original for the purpose of providing a context-specific view on it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each repository serves a community. Different communities require different governance and authorization models. Often&#xD;
    in development context a rather coarse grained &quot;workgroup&quot; model is used to facilitate collaboration where any member&#xD;
    of a workgroup can pretty much perform any operation on an artifact once in the scope of the workgroup; on the other&#xD;
    hand, governance requirements for deployed services often imply a much more fine grained and restrictive model for who&#xD;
    can perform which tasks on specific artifacts. Rather than trying to unify these authorization models,&amp;nbsp;you&#xD;
    can&amp;nbsp;introduce &quot;bridging&quot; roles in each community that are authorized to make content from one environment&#xD;
    available in another environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As part of determining ownership and mastership of the asset and metadata, some key metadata must be addressed,&#xD;
    specifically regarding classification and access control. The classification schemas and access control must be&#xD;
    coordinated between repositories. The enterprise should be careful to not betray the access control rights of an asset&#xD;
    in another repository and thereby open up the asset to access it was intended to protect.&#xD;
