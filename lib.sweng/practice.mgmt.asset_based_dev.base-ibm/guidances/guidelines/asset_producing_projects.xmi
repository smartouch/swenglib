&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;>&lt;/a>Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To describe a process that produces a Reusable Asset, without specifying the kind of asset being produced, requires a&#xD;
    more generic process than RUP. However, the RUP practices, and most tasks and artifacts apply to a project that&#xD;
    produces Reusable Assets, even when the assets are not executable software, such as reusable requirements or reusable&#xD;
    designs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following describes how RUP applies in general to an asset production project. Note that this is not a complete&#xD;
    description since a complete description is dependent on the kind of assets being produced. For example, if no code is&#xD;
    produced, then code metrics, code reviews, and unit tests are out of scope. RUP, and the asset-based development&#xD;
    activities need to be tailored to the specific project, based on the assets to be produced and the target asset&#xD;
    consumers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;PM2&quot; name=&quot;PM2&quot;>&lt;/a>Project Management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some characteristics of asset production projects are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The asset consumers can be people on existing projects, planned projects, and as yet unplanned projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The asset being managed may not be executable software, and so only some subset of RUP guidance is applicable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Iterative development and risk management are key themes, as with any RUP project. Development of the asset can and&#xD;
    should be iterative when possible. That is, prioritize features and deliver incremental versions of the asset, and&#xD;
    prove the value of the increments through actual use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The risks may include technical risks as well as business risks. The asset's complexity may be too great for the asset&#xD;
    consumers, or the business may not be able to pay for the maintenance and care of the asset. Risks should be identified&#xD;
    early and mitigation plans should be established.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Planning should consider the effort of creating/harvesting the artifacts, producing the packaging and documentation,&#xD;
    certifying and validating the asset, and maintaining the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Case (which may be the responsibility of the organization reuse program, rather than the asset production&#xD;
    project) should include the following considerations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The recurring problem the asset is to provide a solution to.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The value the asset could bring to the company. The anticipated return on investment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The anticipated reuse scope, such as personal, team, department, enterprise, public, and so on&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The potential asset consumers, how many there are, and what are their skill sets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The anticipated costs for producing, maintaining, and reusing the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The asset's owner and maintainer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The asset's sponsor (who will pay for it).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The longevity of the asset: Is the business' domain sufficiently stable to support the requirements for the asset&#xD;
        over multiple reuses?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost/trade-off analysis: What are the cost tradeoffs if the asset is to be built for one time use?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;env2&quot; name=&quot;env2&quot;>&lt;/a>Environment&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Before asset-based production tasks can be performed, an environment must be set up that supports these tasks. There&#xD;
    needs to be an environment that allows the assets to be packaged and delivered to the organization reuse program.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The delivery process should be updated to include the project's asset-based development tooling. For more information&#xD;
    on tooling to support asset-based development, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/tools/ram_abd_14888083.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_6mYH8PDQEdq7ls4zEErftg&quot;>Tool: Rational Asset Manager&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project-specific guidelines may also need to be modified to reflect the refined workflows. For more information on&#xD;
    preparing project-specific guidelines, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev_gov.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/preparing_project_specific_reuse_guidelines_1D014F26.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;8.994384407791297E-306&quot;>Guideline: Preparing Project-Specific Reuse Guidelines&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;requirements2&quot; name=&quot;requirements2&quot;>&lt;/a>Requirements&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All projects, including asset production projects, need to identify and manage requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main difference is that the requirements aren't necessarily for an executing system, and the stakeholders are&#xD;
    different, as described previously. Use Cases, if produced, would typically include the use cases for how the asset is&#xD;
    to be located and applied.&#xD;
&lt;/p>Some specific guidance is provided for producing a Vision. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/vision_for_a_reusable_asset_A0DB9017.html&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;2.25154330357287E-307&quot;>Guideline: Developing a Specification for a Reusable Asset&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;AnD2&quot; name=&quot;AnD2&quot;>&lt;/a>Analysis and Design&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This RUP discipline is focused on the analysis and design for a software product. If the product is not a software&#xD;
    system, but rather some other kind of asset, such as a Design Pattern or a Test Suite, architectural concerns must&#xD;
    still be addressed. For more information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/architecture_of_a_reusable_asset_936B6C05.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;2.977024713464724E-305&quot;>Guideline: Architecture of a Reusable Asset&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's often a good idea to build an architectural prototype of the asset, as a means of mitigating risks and getting&#xD;
    early feedback, even when the asset isn't executable software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Example: A project produced a collection of assets for consumption through a corporate Intranet channel. However, the&#xD;
    target audience did not possess the necessary background to work with the flexibility and inherent complexity of the&#xD;
    assets. The assets had to be simplified and the number of variability points drastically reduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Deployment2&quot; name=&quot;Deployment2&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;CCM2&quot; name=&quot;CCM2&quot;>&lt;/a>Configuration&amp;nbsp;and Change Management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are general tasks that apply to the production of any Reusable Asset. This includes harvesting existing&#xD;
    artifacts, developing new artifacts (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/tasks/create_asset_A9FDA423.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_QEOT8PCtEdquxKT1X5kJ4g&quot;>Task: Create Asset&lt;/a>), update existing artifacts (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/tasks/update_asset_78B3216C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_RxMzIPCtEdquxKT1X5kJ4g&quot;>Task: Update Asset&lt;/a>) packaging the artifacts into Reusable Assets, versioning an&#xD;
    asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;other2&quot; name=&quot;other2&quot;>&lt;/a>Other Disciplines&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As noted previously, all disciplines are applied as relevant to the specific kind of Reusable Asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implementation and Test disciplines specifically describe implementing and testing executable software, and so&#xD;
    predominantly apply when the asset is executable software.&lt;br />&#xD;
