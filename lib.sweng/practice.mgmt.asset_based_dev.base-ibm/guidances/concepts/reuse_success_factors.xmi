    Reuse Success Factors&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several key factors that must be addressed for reuse, including:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Management Support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identifying The Right Asset To Build&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Versioning and Configuration Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training For Producers and Consumers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measuring Productivity and Quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sponsorship and Maintenance of Assets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communication of Asset Status to Asset Consumers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Commitment to High Quality Assets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Well Understood Domains&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customizable, Coarse-Grained Reuse&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architectures Established To Create and Use Assets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process and Organizational Structure to Support Reuse&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Management Support&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As in most cases, you must have top-down executive support to accomplish things in your organization. In the case of&#xD;
    assets and reuse, this is extremely critical. A key point here is that the implementation strategy for reuse is&#xD;
    generally best accomplished bottom up. This is due to the need for the assets to be proven, and to grow in value. It is&#xD;
    also true that the assets must be verified in broader contexts over time. In addition, there is an inherent increase in&#xD;
    cost as the reuse scope of an asset increases from, for instance,&amp;nbsp;a project level, to a department level, to an&#xD;
    enterprise level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    So the general guideline is to achieve top-down support while implementing the asset program bottom-up.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Identifying The Right Asset To Build&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next to management support, this is extremely critical to get right. This is about deciding where and how the business&#xD;
    will invest in assets. A most important perspective to obtain is not to&amp;nbsp;measure the organization's success based&#xD;
    on the number of assets in the repository. &lt;strong>The more correct perspective is to evaluate success based on the&#xD;
    value the assets bring to the organization.&lt;/strong> Understanding the number of assets in the organization is a useful&#xD;
    measurement, but it is not the determining factor for success with assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To identify the right asset to build, focus on understanding the recurring problems in the organization, or within the&#xD;
    reuse scope on which&amp;nbsp;you are currently focused. For each recurring problem, then focus on what the solution is for&#xD;
    that problem. Make sure that&amp;nbsp;you understand who is feeling the pain of the problem and the joy of the solution.&#xD;
    Then determine who will pay for and own this solution. Now you are getting close to understanding which asset to build.&#xD;
    This is not enough. You also need to understand the target consumer, what channels will be used to deliver the asset to&#xD;
    the consumer, what&amp;nbsp;are the consumer's skill sets, and how rapidly are the technology and the domain for this asset&#xD;
    changing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When determining the right asset to build, focus on the consumer and the value to the consumer. Do not create assets&#xD;
    unless you can first identify a consumer that will gain repeated value from the asset. Without considering these items&#xD;
    the business investment is often at risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Versioning and Configuration Management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assets have two levels of versions associated with them. The first is the version of the artifacts within the asset.&#xD;
    The version control system generally owns the policy for determining the version of the artifacts. The second is the&#xD;
    version of the asset. Typically the Asset Manufacturing team, Marketing, or another business entity owns the policy for&#xD;
    determining the asset version.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;286&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/asset_version.gif&quot; width=&quot;439&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Training For Producers and Consumers&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Those producing and consuming assets must be trained on the changes in development processes, as well as the asset&#xD;
    concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Measuring Productivity and Quality&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measuring, reporting, and refining the asset-based development effort is critical to the ongoing effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Sponsorship and Maintenance of Assets&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an oft-overlooked issue. Setting up the initial funding of an asset is generally well understood. However, the&#xD;
    real cost to the business is the long-term commitment to, and maintenance of, the asset. The initial additional costs&#xD;
    of building a reusable asset are only&amp;nbsp;the beginning&amp;nbsp;of the cost of the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Communication of Asset Status to Asset Consumers&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is critical to understand who is using what asset and on a what project. Impact analysis must be conducted for each&#xD;
    asset&amp;nbsp;when defects are fixed and new versions of the asset are rolled out. Those using the assets need to&#xD;
    understand how this impacts them and their commitment to use the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Commitment to High Quality Assets&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many examples of repositories that contain junk yards of material. While a junk yard may have some value, it&#xD;
    does not possess the high-frequency, highly-needed model of asset use. Governing the asset submission, approval,&#xD;
    management, and publishing activities&amp;nbsp;is critical to keeping asset quality high. The enterprise needs to determine&#xD;
    what a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/well_formed_asset_768653EE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_vI2YEPD5Edq7ls4zEErftg&quot;>Well-Formed Asset&lt;/a> is, and to what policies the asset must comply.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Well Understood Domains&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly invest in assets a well-known set of problems with a well-known set of solutions must be understood. This&#xD;
    is fundamental to the successfully reuse of assets. Avoid the temptation to create assets and toss them into a&#xD;
    repository without the due diligence to verify that they address the recurring problems and solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Customizable, Coarse-Grained Reuse&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scaling reuse to more coarse-grained solutions improves the value proposition of assets. In general, the finer-grained&#xD;
    assets are produced first and then can be combined through &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/composingsolutions_recipes_8BD29681.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_ciVFUPCrEdquxKT1X5kJ4g&quot;>Composing Solutions: Recipes&lt;/a> into more coarse-grained solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Architectures Established To Create and Use Assets&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software-related assets, such as components and services, are more reusable&amp;nbsp;when the expected architecture within&#xD;
    which the asset is to be reused is well understood. This should be addressed early in the asset-based development&#xD;
    activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Process and Organizational Structure to Support Reuse&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order for reuse to succeed within the organization, there generally must be a team&amp;nbsp;that focuses on&#xD;
    manufacturing assets. The challenge of this is that there are many technology domains for which reusable assets may be&#xD;
    created, and it is difficult if not impossible to have one team that has all of the experts needed. As such, you&#xD;
    generally have a core team that understands the principles of asset manufacturing, and you have visiting experts that&#xD;
    join for a time to give guidance on the development of specific asset types. The enterprise needs to support this&#xD;
    activity of harvesting expert knowledge into reusable assets, when and where it makes sense to the business.&#xD;
