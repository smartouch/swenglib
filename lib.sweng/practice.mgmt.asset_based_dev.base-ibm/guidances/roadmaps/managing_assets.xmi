  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of asset management is to provide control and organization to the review and approval workflow, delivering&#xD;
    assets to consumers in a managed, scalable manner. Asset management is subject to and operates under the policies and&#xD;
    guidance from &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev_gov.base-ibm/guidances/roadmaps/governing_assets_252E43E2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_jnQJgPWhEdqUi-oYjeSt8w&quot;>Governing Assets&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Management Workflows and Tasks are organized into directed workflows where the tasks occur in a sequence and&#xD;
    in a non-ordered tasks where the tasks occur at multiple points, without order prescribed. The Review / Approval&#xD;
    Workflow below represents the directed workflow where the tasks occur in the sequence presented. The number of tasks&#xD;
    and their order may vary and should be customized for your needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Supporting Workflow Tasks are non-ordered and may occur at multiple points throughout the Review / Approval&#xD;
    Workflow. For example, an asset may be classified multiple times throughout the Review / Approval Workflow, or the&#xD;
    asset's entitlements may be refined and specified multiple times throughout the Review / Approval Workflow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Other Tasks include those&amp;nbsp;that are a key part of the Asset Management Workflows and Tasks, but which are not&#xD;
    specifically associated with the Review and Approval Workflow.&#xD;
