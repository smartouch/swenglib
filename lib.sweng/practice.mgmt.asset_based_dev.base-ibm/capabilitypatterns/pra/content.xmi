    <purpose>The purpose of this capability pattern is to produce a Reusable Asset.</purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This capability pattern&amp;nbsp;requires a range of skills that depend on the type of asset that is being produced. For&#xD;
    example, an asset may be a set of requirements documents, or it may be a collection of models and source code with&#xD;
    their attendant test scripts. Thus, the type of asset being produced will directly affect the staffing required for&#xD;
    this&amp;nbsp;capability pattern.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All of the roles involved in the production of an asset work closely together to make sure that the right asset is&#xD;
    produced and that it is usable.&#xD;
&lt;/p></howtoStaff>
    <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This capability pattern should be used in all projects whenever assets are to be produced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reusable Assets are best produced in an iterative fashion. The artifacts that contribute to the asset can be produced&#xD;
    throughout the software lifecycle. However, in an asset production project, the product is a reusable asset, so it is&#xD;
    in the&amp;nbsp;Transition phase that the asset is released for use by asset consumers.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing a reusable asset generally requires additional effort and cost to the organization. The effort, and&#xD;
    therefore its associated cost, is expended in preparing the asset's artifacts, creating supporting packaging material,&#xD;
    such as documentation and guidance for the Asset Consumer, submitting the asset and preparing the metadata, and&#xD;
    conducting reviews and approvals of the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, it becomes necessary to govern the asset creation process. A critical step in this governance is to&#xD;
    understand what the recurring problems are&amp;nbsp;that will justify the costs for developing a reusable asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As asset ideas come forward, the organization should conduct recurring problem analysis to justify the development and&#xD;
    long-term maintenance of the asset. This analysis may vary in rigor and formality depending on the nature and type of&#xD;
    the proposed reusable asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a proposed asset to provide sorting of values in a list may likely have the recurring problem analysis&#xD;
    handled informally amongst a development team or perhaps across several teams. In contrast,&amp;nbsp;a tax calculation&#xD;
    service will likely require more formal coordination and verification of the problem, its context and the proposed&#xD;
    solution.&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset specification describes the asset being proposed. The specification should provide technical justification&#xD;
    for the asset. Not all assets will require an asset specification. In general assets which will require or it is&#xD;
    expected to require a meaningful investment for the organization, or of sufficient complexity or reuse scope as to&#xD;
    require multiple teams will benefit from creating an asset specification. The asset specification may go through&#xD;
    several iterations as greater understanding of the problem and the solution are gathered from stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The need for this asset has generally been established, and sometimes sponsorship and support for the asset has been&#xD;
    secured. This specification can be used by the support teams to understand the asset. It also certainly can and should&#xD;
    be used by the asset owner or producer to create and update the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This specification is largely intended for technical teams to use, although it can be shared with sponsors and&#xD;
    technical management as part of making decisions to fund and staff the effort to build, maintain, and support the&#xD;
    asset. The specification should include the following:&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task the asset artifacts are created and/or harvested. The asset is created according to the Asset&#xD;
    Specification. Packaging the asset includes preparing documentation and supporting material to provide easy&#xD;
    comprehension of the asset. The asset's metadata, such as name, description, and anticipated context is prepared.&#xD;
    Finally the asset is submitted to the Repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Major considerations in creating assets:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the recurring problem and proposed solution; the Asset Specification addresses this.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand and develop for the intended Asset Consumer, including:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Identifying how it is expected the Asset Consumer will discover the asset (this affects both classification&#xD;
                of the asset as well as the packaging material that is prepared)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The anticipated context(s) the Asset Consumer will be in (such as a development context, or a runtime&#xD;
                context, or a business context), as well as the skill set of the Asset Consumer&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand who will fund, maintain and support the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the asset versioning strategy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Specification will identify a possible asset type. Each asset is of a single type, and can be classified&#xD;
    multiple times. For example,&amp;nbsp;you can take an asset such as a stock quote service.&amp;nbsp;You can determine the asset&#xD;
    type is Service, and&amp;nbsp;you may classify the stock quote service as a &quot;non-commercial&quot; service, and as a &quot;domestic&quot;&#xD;
    service, providing quotes for only domestic traded stocks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Looking at several of the steps of creating assets, they have direct impact on the consumability of the asset, for&#xD;
    instance:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Creating or harvesting artifacts: impacts the usability of the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Packaging the asset: impacts the comprehension of the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Categorizing the asset: impacts the searching and discoverability of the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This point cannot be emphasized enough. The steps of creating an asset should be focused on the Asset Consumer, for&#xD;
    both their ease of use and for&amp;nbsp;the downstream maintenance.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Owner role is a person or an organization that defines and submits the asset version, as well as updates or&#xD;
    removes the asset version. The Asset Owner is the original creator of the asset version.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A new asset version can be created by a new Asset Owner. This means the repository can have the following assets:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset name: Credit Report Service&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An asset is described with metadata and has artifacts, each of which can be modified. The nature of the modification,&#xD;
    or update, dictates if a new asset version is required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is up to the organization to establish the asset versioning policies, such as when a new asset version is required.&#xD;
    For example, modifying a grammar issue in the metadata may be deemed by some to not require a new asset version.&#xD;
    Whereas if the grammar issue is in one of the artifacts, then some may state that a new asset version is required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A general guideline to follow is to categorize asset modifications as structural and non-structural. Structural changes&#xD;
    include modifying the following items:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Metadata&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;list-style: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Asset version&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Asset relationship&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Artifact reference&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Artifact&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;list-style: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                File name or path or content&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, these kinds of changes require a new asset version to be created. Non-structural changes are modifications&#xD;
    to asset metadata other than those described; and do not require a new asset version.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization needs to determine the tolerance level for changes before requiring a new asset version. When the new&#xD;
    version is created then the asset review and approval activities take place.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As assets are submitted to the Repository the relevant parties are notified of their role in the review process. Some&#xD;
    may be in the role of Reviewers whereas others are in the role of the Review Board. There are many possible review&#xD;
    processes given the variety of asset types, cultures, and other restrictions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The review processes are defined per Community. There are three kinds of review processes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        AS-IS&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Built-in&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Extensible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Built-in and Extensible review processes can use a Review Board. The Review Board provides oversight to the review&#xD;
    process, they can modify the set of reviewers, initiate the review process, and cast final votes on the asset. Without&#xD;
    a Review Board the Reviewers are notified and the assets are approved/rejected based on the votes cast by the&#xD;
    Reviewers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 814px; HEIGHT: 583px&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; alt=&quot;Review Process with and without Review Board.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/builtinreview_comparereviewboard.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As-Is: this really means there is no review process, meaning that assets submitted using AS-IS are automatically&#xD;
        approved. Administrators normally have to approve this.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Built-in: in this case the Asset Repository provides fundamental asset review capabilities which can be configured&#xD;
        by the Administrator. Review Board members and reviewers can be identified to review assets of a particular type,&#xD;
        owner, or classification. The Asset Repository notifies participants when an asset comes in for a review process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Extensible: this kind of review process is customizable to reflect the workflow the enterprise needs. This review&#xD;
        process is specified by a process language or by a change management system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many possible review processes given the variety of asset types, cultures, and other restrictions. The review&#xD;
    process can be netted to two major groups, the Review Board and the Reviewers. The review process was specified in the&#xD;
    Task: Configure Repository. If the Review Board is enabled then for each asset that is submitted the Review Board&#xD;
    should be notified and they begin their activities. The Review Board will plan the review, select reviewers, initiate&#xD;
    the review, evaluate the submitted reviews, and cast the final, deciding vote on the asset. In the image below a&#xD;
    built-in review process has been specified called &quot;Service Implementation Review&quot; for assets of type &quot;Service&#xD;
    Implementation&quot;. A Review Board has been enabled, this means they will cast the final vote on the asset. Also one&#xD;
    review has been identified, by name, rather than by role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the Reviewers are notified of the review they can claim the review request and conduct the review and submit the&#xD;
    review with vote to the Repository. Reviewers may also suggest other Reviewers to the Review Board. If the Review Board&#xD;
    is not enabled for the review, then the votes from the Reviewers determine if the asset is accepted or rejected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The actual set of reviewers, the steps of the review process, and the parties involved generally requires customization&#xD;
    for each organization.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the asset is made visible to a target audience that goes beyond the Repository. As part of the normal&#xD;
    asset review activities, the asset may transition to the state of Approved. It is then&amp;nbsp;visible to the Asset&#xD;
    Consumers with the appropriate access control.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, here&amp;nbsp;you are interested in making the asset visible to other target audiences. This task will largely&#xD;
    take place as certain asset types, such as Service Interfaces, are published into service registries.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this case the Service Interface likely has several key artifacts such as the WSDL,&amp;nbsp;and XSDs. At this point, the&#xD;
    approved Service Interface asset is selected and the target service registry is identified. The contents of the Service&#xD;
    Interface (or whatever asset type it may be) asset are published to the service registry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This can affect the state of the asset in the Repository by&amp;nbsp;transitioning to something such as &quot;published&quot;.&#xD;
    Publishing the asset introduces some issues around classification and security. The classification of the asset in the&#xD;
    Repository may not map directly to the classification that is available in the target repository or registry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another consideration is security and access control. In some cases the access control between the two systems may be&#xD;
    dissimilar. It is critical that one Repository does not betray the access control specified in another repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A development-time repository is focused on the governance of assets to aid the development organization. The runtime&#xD;
    service registry is focused on the governance of services into and out of production environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 638px; HEIGHT: 343px&quot; height=&quot;550&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;The contents of the Service Interface asset are published to the service registry.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/image14.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;322&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>When publishing an asset to another repository or registry, the administrators will also need to deal with duplicated&#xD;
data and how to handle updates and new versions. It is also necessary to consider which system is the source of record for&#xD;
the asset or some portion of the asset.</refinedDescription>

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defining the asset types for one or more organizations&#xD;

    This team creates and uses Asset Specifications to create and maintain assets. The intended scope of the team should be&#xD;
    defined. Will the team be responsible for creating assets for the declared reuse scope at the enterprise level or the&#xD;
    divisional level? Will the team create the assets, or is the purpose of the team to clean up assets and prepare them&#xD;
    for reuse?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Directly associated with the scope of the Asset Manufacturing Teams is the manufacturing process. There are several&#xD;
    models to consider. These models use the basic producer and consumer model for assets. The premise is that an&#xD;
    organization is focused on the creation of assets and another organization is focused on the usage of assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In more mature organizations, the assets having a wider scope and impact are developed by special teams as part of an&#xD;
    Asset Manufacturing Center or Excellence Center. This role captures the responsibilities and the tasks performed by&#xD;
    these development groups with regard to the asset production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The image below describes such an organization which has a clean split between the asset production and the asset&#xD;
    consumption aspects of its development practices:&#xD;
