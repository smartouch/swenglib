&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work is best done when the asset consumer has a well-defined problem that needs to be resolved. The asset&#xD;
    consumer's understanding of the problem directly affects the activities of searching and evaluating an asset for its&#xD;
    relevance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work may be done across multiple work sessions, and it&amp;nbsp;may be interrupted at any point in the activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is possible that after applying a reusable asset, a refined asset may be repackaged for others to use. For example,&#xD;
    applying a domain reference architecture reusable asset, and configuring it for a specific application context, may&#xD;
    result in an application reference architecture that could be further applied in additional contexts. In such cases,&#xD;
    the individual filling the role of the asset consumer would identify the produced application reference architecture as&#xD;
    a candidate for further reuse. This feeds in to the organizational reuse program, which decides which reusable assets&#xD;
    to produce.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this workflow is to locate and apply &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/reusable_asset_A38D118D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B40F6CE7-C2CF-49DB-A805-2FBDC885102D}&quot;>Reusable Asset&lt;/a>s to solve specific problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset consumer needs to understand the mechanics of reusing the asset at two levels:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to locate and evaluate the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to reuse the asset, and&amp;nbsp;what level of interaction with the asset is required to reuse the asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset consumer may be an entire team, or it may be an individual. This is driven by several factors, including the&#xD;
    nature of the assets being evaluated, as well as the skills of those conducting the evaluation and reuse.&#xD;
&lt;/p></howtoStaff>
    <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This capability pattern should be used in all projects whenever an asset is to be consumed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Inception Phase of a software application project, asset consumption generally focuses on assets relating to&#xD;
    requirements and other artifacts&amp;nbsp;that describe the problem space. The assets used during this phase should help&#xD;
    provide clarification to the problem space. These assets can provide high-leverage for the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The early Elaboration Phase of a software application project focuses on creating an initial architecture for the&#xD;
    system. Reusing architectural assets at this point can provide a significant starting point. If the architecture&#xD;
    already exists (because it was produced in previous iterations in previous projects), the focus of the work changes to&#xD;
    refining the architecture and identifying assets which can provide this capability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the Elaboration and Construction Phases of a software application project, assets for implementing the system&#xD;
    are needed.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several styles of searching, some more structured than others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One structured approach to searching is to use &lt;strong>values&lt;/strong> from category schemas. This approach implies&#xD;
    that the assets in the repository have been classified according to the category schema. And then these values are&#xD;
    available as filters&amp;nbsp;that can be selected and combined with other filters to create a search query. This approach&#xD;
    is useful if the category schema is well understood by the Asset Consumer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Searching with &lt;strong>keywords&lt;/strong> is a little less structured and it does imply the keyword or something similar&#xD;
    to it is found in the assets. When searching with keywords the matches may be found in the asset metadata or it may be&#xD;
    found in the asset artifacts. Some Repositories provide fuzzy searching, taking into consideration misspelled words or&#xD;
    similar words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A less structured style of searching is to use &lt;strong>tags&lt;/strong>. With this approach the Asset Consumer associates&#xD;
    their own word(s) with the asset; this allows the Asset Consumer to view one or more assets in the repository using&#xD;
    their own words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the challenges for Asset Consumers conducting searches is to browse result lists as the number of assets in the&#xD;
    repository grows. Reducing the number of clicks to arrive at a useful, not-overwhelming result list becomes a&#xD;
    challenge.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is possible to combine multiple search techniques into a single search query. For example, an Asset Consumer may use&#xD;
    some keywords, combined with several filters to create a search query, such as &quot;claims&quot; with the filters &quot;Type:&#xD;
    service&quot; and &quot;State: Approved&quot;. This means the Repository could search for assets of type Service, in the state of&#xD;
    Approved, containing the term &quot;claims&quot; somewhere in the metadata or the asset artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another helpful technique to minimize search efforts is to leverage asset relationships. Creating coarse-grained assets&#xD;
    which &quot;contain&quot; other assets, either by-value or by-reference, can dramatically cut down on the search time and effort.&#xD;
    See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;{B40F6CE7-C2CF-49DB-A805-2FBDC885102D}&quot;>Reusable Assets&lt;/a> to which the asset consumer has access. It may&#xD;
    include asset catalogs and repositories (hosted by the organization or a third party on the Internet), as well as&#xD;
    internal repositories (on the user's local hard disk, a project's local network, and/or an organization's Intranet).&#xD;
    Such a definition of the Asset&amp;nbsp;Repository is essential because it offers much greater flexibility to the asset&#xD;
    consumer, and it supports a wider ecosystem for asset creation, management, and application.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Repository represents the context in which Reusable Assets are published. Describing it as a composite&#xD;
    artifact is really an optimization from a process description point of view, which provides a way to describe where&#xD;
    assets are published, and what assets are searched for, generically, without having to repeatedly say that the &quot;reuse&#xD;
    library&quot; could be a company-wide repository, a project-wide repository, a third-party repository, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset&amp;nbsp;Repository supports different kinds of context-dependent searches, navigation, and retrieval of assets&#xD;
    (or parts of assets).&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using an asset is the main purpose of creating an asset. There is reuse costs associated with using an asset. There are&#xD;
    several factors affecting the costs of reusing an asset, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time and effort to search, browse and evaluate an asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The complexity of the asset, which can affect the effort to evaluate the asset, as well as the effort to reuse the&#xD;
        asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Nature and quality of asset packaging material which affects effort to comprehend.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The level or degree of customization of an asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mitigating these factors with well-organized, well-designed, and well-packaged assets directly affects the breakeven&#xD;
    point, or rather, payoff threshold. See Asset Production tasks to address guidance on well-formed assets to benefit&#xD;
    Asset Consumers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Black box and white box reuse, or, reusing an asset &quot;as-is&quot; and reusing an asset making internal modifications impacts&#xD;
    the usage strategy for an asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Black box style reuse implies the asset internals are not open to the Asset Consumer and it is manipulated only by&#xD;
    formal controls. Services are a great example of black box reuse, providing a formal interface that exposes some level&#xD;
    of control through parameters and messages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design models may be white box reuse if the Asset Producer permits access to manipulate the model. White box reuse&#xD;
    implies a requirement to maintain the consumed asset.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several forms of asset feedback. Some are quantitative, and some are qualitative. To offer feedback, the&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Comments: this is providing textual description of experiences with an asset, and is generally given in a single&#xD;
        direction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discussions: discussion threads or forums provide a community approach to addressing feedback.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Problems or Issues: this is more formal feedback where a problem number may be retrieved and the asset development&#xD;
        team tracks the submitted issue and responds with future releases of the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
