    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is possible, but unlikely, that an organization will use both business processes and business use cases to describe&#xD;
    the behavior of the business.&amp;nbsp; Because of this, usually only one of the two behavior-oriented service&#xD;
    identification tasks will be performed on a given project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many organizations will dispense with using the Business Functional Model candidate service discovery technique,&#xD;
    because they are strongly focused on identifying services that explicitly support business processes.&amp;nbsp; If you&#xD;
    decide to not use this technique explicitly to identify services, we suggest that you still use the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/workproducts/functional_area_model_A10F922.html&quot; guid=&quot;_hbPxMHbuEd68WpJEWd56Wg&quot;>Functional Area Model&lt;/a> to check the results of your behavior-oriented service&#xD;
    discovery efforts.&amp;nbsp; Each candidate service that is identified using a behavior model (business process or business&#xD;
    use case) should be mappable back to a function in the Functional Area Model.&#xD;

    Identifying candidate services from business functional models is one of several schemes which complement each other&#xD;
    during candidate services identification.&amp;nbsp; Omitting any of the methods increases the risk that some candidate&#xD;
    services will not be discovered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This particular technique provides a valuable coverage check on the results obtained from identifying candidate&#xD;
    services&amp;nbsp;using business process analysis.&amp;nbsp; The business functions in the functional area model are expected&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;be essentially identical to the process tasks that are allocated to functional areas during &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_70D1DA00.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0XDGMEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>business process decomposition&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; So, the two techniques&amp;nbsp;are expected&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;yield similar sets of large-grained service operations.&amp;nbsp; If this is not the case, this indicates that&#xD;
    either the business functional model or the process model&amp;nbsp;is incomplete.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    Candidate services&amp;nbsp;can be mapped to the&amp;nbsp;business services which are identified during functional area&#xD;
    analysis at two levels:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Individual business&amp;nbsp;functions can be mapped to individual candidate services&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business service interfaces (collections of cohesive business functions) can be mapped to individual candidate&#xD;
        services&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business service interfaces coming out of the functional area analysis will be manifested either as&amp;nbsp;interfaces&#xD;
    on the functional areas or&amp;nbsp;interfaces on business systems that are allocated to functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the work product slot of [Business Design] is filled by the Functional Area Model.&#xD;

    One of the objectives of IT-centric SOA is to effectively automate the business.&amp;nbsp; With this in mind, it is clear&#xD;
    that &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_6DC80DFA.html&quot; guid=&quot;_zjPQgIqmEd64Ytrb_zySHw&quot;>business process&lt;/a> models are a source of ideas for identifying IT services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Service identification normally is performed using a process model that is decomposed to the level of business tasks&#xD;
    that can be mapped to system use cases (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_70D1DA00.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0XDGMEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Concept: Business Process Decomposition&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp; Using this decomposed model,&#xD;
    candidate services at many levels of granularity can be identified:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that&amp;nbsp;coordinate the execution of full business processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that&amp;nbsp;coordinate the execution of sub-processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that coordinate the execution of system use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that perform specific, limited functions, such as services that are responsible for a specific business&#xD;
        calculation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of these service types has value.&amp;nbsp; Their discovered instances are viable candidate services.&#xD;

    Identifying candidate services from business use case realizations is one of several schemes that complement each&#xD;
    other during candidate services identification. Omitting any of the methods increases the risk that some candidate&#xD;
    services will not be discovered.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task uses &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.bus.use_case_driven_business_modeling.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_uc_realization_B9B77CA3.html&quot; guid=&quot;_NFkXsGDYEd6EnMwJEA4c6A&quot;>business use-case realizations&lt;/a> as input and identifies a set of candidate services&#xD;
    that are included in the project candidate service portfolio. These candidate services might yet require additional&#xD;
    refinement, however the steps included here provide an effective manner in which to produce an initial set of service&#xD;
    candidates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case realization describes interactions between actors and business-relevant elements, to deliver&#xD;
    something of measurable value to one or more of the actors.&amp;nbsp; As is true with business processes, business use&#xD;
    cases -- and their associated realizations -- can be defined at various levels of detail within the business (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/decomposing_business_processes_4B6C7EDB.html&quot; guid=&quot;_5Mi1gEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Guideline: Decomposing Business Processes&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp; At the highest level, the business&#xD;
    elements involved in the realization might be business domains.&amp;nbsp; The next level of detail might involve&#xD;
    interacting functional areas.&amp;nbsp; Going yet another level down, the interacting elements might be business subsystems&#xD;
    or business workers within a functional area (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/functional_area_analysis_9B1F96D5.html&quot; guid=&quot;_fk1woEo1Ed6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Concept: Functional Area Analysis&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analysis performed at each of these levels of&amp;nbsp;detail can be valuable,&amp;nbsp;because they will result in operations&#xD;
    that represent different levels of entry into the overall business behavior.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations&amp;nbsp;discovered at the level of interacting business domains might represent initiation of large-scale&#xD;
        business processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations discovered at the level of interacting functional areas might represent initiation of significant&#xD;
        sub-processes that are wholly owned by a functional area&#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations discovered at the level of interacting business subsystems might represent entry points into leaf-level&#xD;
        sub-processes, which are the gateways to IT system use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
