    1. Assign Attributes&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually there is a requirements management plan which&amp;nbsp;defines the Requirements Attributes to be tracked for each&#xD;
    type of requirement. Important attributes are Benefit (from the stakeholders' perspectives), the Effort to implement,&#xD;
    the Risk to the development effort, the Stability (likelihood to remain unchanged), and Architectural Impact (is it&#xD;
    architecturally significant) of each requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Benefit and Stability are set in consultation with the stakeholders. Effort and Risk are set in consultation with&#xD;
    the system architects. Architectural Impact is set by the system architect.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Unstable requirements with high risk, high effort, or high benefit should be flagged for more analysis. Low benefit&#xD;
    requirements with high effort, risk, or instability should be flagged for potential removal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    2. Establish and Verify Traceability&#xD;
&lt;/h4>There should be a definition on how requirements types are traced to other work products.&amp;nbsp;You must establish the&#xD;
required Traceability, and periodically use traceability reports to ensure that traceability is maintained in accordance&#xD;
with the plan. &#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    3. Manage Changing Requirements&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements changes are managed according to the plan. Some additional guidelines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reassess requirements attributes and traceability: even if a requirements hasn't changed, the attributes and the&#xD;
        traceability associated with a requirement can change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Manage change hierarchically: a change to one requirement might have a &quot;ripple&quot; effect that affects other related&#xD;
        requirements, design, or other work products.&amp;nbsp; To manage this effect, you should change the requirements from&#xD;
        the top down. Review the impact on the&amp;nbsp;requirements work products, then the design work products, and then the&#xD;
        production material.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to manage the impact of requirements change on the test effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        Traceability reports are useful in determining the potentially affected elements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
