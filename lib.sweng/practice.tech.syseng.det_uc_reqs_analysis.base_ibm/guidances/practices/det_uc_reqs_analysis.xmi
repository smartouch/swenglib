    Value proposition:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enables early collaboration with stakeholders to validate requirements to provide foundation for system&#xD;
        architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        More rapid achievement and more complete set of use-cases and non-functional requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The system specification is the process of designating the blackbox features of the system: its externally visible&#xD;
    functionality, what services it provides, and what measures of effectiveness it is expected to meet. It consists of&#xD;
    studying how the system is expected to perform in context. That is, the system is considered a participant in a broader&#xD;
    enterprise. The system specification follows from an analysis of the enterprise and the role the system plays in&#xD;
    enabling the broader enterprise to meet its business purpose or mission. This is the work done with use case&#xD;
    requirements analysis. Understanding context is critical in creating systems that accomplish the goals for which they&#xD;
    are built.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understanding context, then, means understanding the interaction of the system with entities external to it (actors),&#xD;
    understanding the services required of the system, and understanding what gets exchanged between the system and its&#xD;
    actors. Understanding context is also important for ensuring that the appropriate requirements exist or will be&#xD;
    developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the most important contexts to consider is usage, that is, how a system is used, and how it interacts with&#xD;
    entities outside itself as it is used. Why? Because our purpose is to develop a system, or enhance an existing one, one&#xD;
    of our most important considerations should be that the system is useful. If we can base our designs on the actual&#xD;
    usages to which the system is to be put, we will be assured that we build what is needed. After all, systems are built&#xD;
    to be used!&#xD;

    The best way to review a practice is to adopt a multi-prong approach:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use different perspectives driven by artifacts, activities, test cycles,&amp;nbsp;or roles. Shift between them when&#xD;
        your focus changes from what you need to produce to how or to&amp;nbsp;when an activity is performed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Start with the related artifacts and decide which ones are important to you and your organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze the main&amp;nbsp;work pattern, which gives an overview of all of the activities performed as part of a typical&#xD;
        iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Drill down into each activity to better understand the tasks and artifacts employed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also review the guidelines, concepts, and. if applicable, tool-related guidance.&#xD;
&lt;/p></application>
