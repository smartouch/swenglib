    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select the system use cases (and scenarios derived from these) to be realized, and thus used to derive subsystem,&#xD;
    process, and locality requirements. The selection of system use cases and scenarios is driven by the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The benefit of the scenario to stakeholders: critical, important, useful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The architectural impact of the scenario: none, extends, modifies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The risks to be mitigated: performance, availability of a product, and suitability of a component.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general the impact on architecture is correlated to the criticality. However, it must be noted that there might be&#xD;
    critical use cases that have little or no impact, and vice versa, and some ancillary use cases can have a big impact on&#xD;
    the architecture, which makes it questionable from a business perspective. The main concern is to select a set of use&#xD;
    cases that ensures broad coverage (participation) of system internals, while still satisfying other constituencies.&#xD;
