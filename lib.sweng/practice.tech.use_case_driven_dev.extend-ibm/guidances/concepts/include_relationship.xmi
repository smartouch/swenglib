  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a use case contains a segment of behavior of which only the result, not the method for getting the result, is of any&#xD;
    importance to the rest of the use case, this behavior can be factored out to a new &lt;b>inclusion use case&lt;/b>. The&#xD;
    original use case then becomes the &lt;b>base use case&lt;/b> in an include-relationship with the inclusion use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An include-relationship between two use cases means that a use-case instance following the description of the base use&#xD;
    case also needs to follow the description of the inclusion use case in order to be complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The include-relationship can help clarify a use case by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Isolating and encapsulating complex details so they do not obscure the real meaning of the use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improving consistency by including behavior which are included in several base use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Generally, more than one use case must include an inclusion use case to make it worth it to maintain an extra use case&#xD;
    and the include-relationship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Only the base use case knows of the relationship between the two use cases; no inclusion use case knows what other use&#xD;
    cases includes it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe the include-relationship by briefly stating the purpose of the inclusion, as well as the location in the base&#xD;
    use case at which the inclusion is to be inserted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When describing the flow of events of the base use case, you&amp;nbsp;must refer to the inclusion at the location in which&#xD;
    the inclusion is inserted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
