  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;includes all training identified for all communities within the organization - including IT, process&#xD;
    and organization. Once identified these training activities are sequenced, prioritized, scoped, staffed, and&#xD;
    resourced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. Appoint one person to be&#xD;
    responsible for all the activities concerning the planning of the rollout:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant education and training a high priority, and get the best people on board.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the plan well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they have time to&#xD;
            digest all the information.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the education and training plan is changed in the middle of rolling out the classes, consider using available&#xD;
    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team&#xD;
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the&#xD;
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the&#xD;
    same as they will use after going live).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If education and training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what&#xD;
    is the best way of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it&#xD;
    takes longer than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The planned lengths of the time for the training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business benefits of the initiative can only be realized if the user community is educated in the new systems and&#xD;
    processes and adopts the desired behaviors. Therefore the objectives of the education and training program are to&#xD;
    provide the users with the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        sufficient skills and knowledge to operate effectively in the new environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            support and encouragement to adopt the required behaviors and attitudes&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            well targeted and delivered education and training courses.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance&#xD;
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it&#xD;
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.&#xD;
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>To provide the basis for managing, monitoring, and evaluating training delivery - by articulating a specific, detailed&#xD;
project plan for the development and delivery of all training related to the implementation of the transformation project.&#xD;
This enables the execution of an education and training strategy.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If many users are involved, the rollout of education and training is also complicated enough to need detailed planning.&#xD;
    A poor rollout will compromise acceptance of the system, and in the worst case a proportion of users will reject it.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If training is not being provided the Education and Training Plan is not required.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the number of participants is limited and if they have been closely associated with the development effort, a&#xD;
    detailed plan may not be necessary. Users will gradually gain most of the necessary knowledge during the&#xD;
    implementation. However, a high level agreed-upon plan must still be created and communicated. In addition, a wrap-up&#xD;
    session may still be beneficial.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The rollout plan for the participant education and training contains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A list of locations available for education and training, and their specifications (classroom, size, number of PCs,&#xD;
        available dates, technical setup, etc.).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            The number of participants to attend each training module and how many times each module should run.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            An identification of who the instructors are for each training module.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Dates and locations for the TTT (Train-the-Trainer) classes.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Scheduling of the pilot classes, and setting aside time for updating the training material, if necessary.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Scheduling of the participant training classes.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            A plan for restoring the exercise data before each class starts.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Arrangements for giving participants hands-on access and support after they have attended the education and&#xD;
            training and before the change is implemented.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            How, when, and where the follow-on education and training will take place after implementation.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
