    The work product&amp;nbsp;includes the actual training material as well as other information such as a detailed description&#xD;
    of the course/s that will be offered, the user roles which will be associated with each course, the type of delivery&#xD;
    method/s to be used, the locations of the classes, quick references, help files, and job aids. These materials may be&#xD;
    as simple as a presentation, or as complex as an entire classroom or distance learning curriculum.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Learning Solutions Material document also contains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A mapping of the system transactions to roles followed by a mapping of those roles into courses.&#xD;

            A description of the delivery method for each course. If a training instance is being used, then indicate the&#xD;
            plan for setup and maintenance of the instance. If using the web, be sure to indicate any plan for establishing&#xD;
            the links to existing or new websites.&#xD;

            A list of locations available for education and training, and their specifications (classroom, size, number of&#xD;
            PCs, available dates, technical setup, etc.). An identification of the instructors for each training module is&#xD;
            included as well as the number of participants to attend each training course and how many times each course&#xD;
            should run.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Based on the roles that are mapped to courses, a curriculum is published and verified with the sponsor.&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations xsi:nil="true"/>
  <purpose>The purpose of the Learning Solution Materials is to ensure the quality and consistency of the training materials, by&#xD;
providing a collection point for the materials as they are developed. The Learning Solution Materials is an embodiment of&#xD;
the learning solution design. The guidance that this work product provides ensures that all aspects of the training effort&#xD;
are complete.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this work product it is not possible to gather all learning information and ensure its continuity of design. It is&#xD;
not possible for the project team or stakeholders to be shown the material to allow them to see that progress is being made&#xD;
and validate that it is in a direction to meet the training requirements without this work product.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This work product is not needed if you are not developing any training materials in your project.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
