  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Plan describes the organization, strategy, resources, and methods used to deploy the new application at&#xD;
    customer sites. The plan identifies the responsibilities of everyone participating in the deployment and is written&#xD;
    from the user's perspective. The Deployment Plan also serves as the project's master document over the migration&#xD;
    period. As such, it contains the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan validates that the proposed solution actually is ready for deployment. It contains the steps needed to&#xD;
        make sure that the solution hardware, software, and documentation are in place to proceed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the people are trained and ready to support the new system. This includes the user, support&#xD;
        and temporary deployment communities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the organization is ready to accept the delivery of the proposed solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The plan verifies that the proper level of contingency planning has taken place and that the appropriate risk&#xD;
        mitigation procedures are ready.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development of the Deployment Plan starts early in the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do not wait until the deployment of the system is imminent to beginning the initial drafts of the document.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the Deployment Plan with the client and all users, including anyone in areas such as systems administration,&#xD;
        database, LAN, and HVAC whose systems or jobs may be involved with the new system.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Obtain client sign-off on all the deployment criteria outlined in the Deployment Plan to help ensure&#xD;
        formal&amp;nbsp;stakeholder approval of the new system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the system is being deployed in multiple releases, the Deployment Plan should relate back to the Release&#xD;
        Plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multiple releases imply multiple deployment periods. The issues associated with each period should be considered&#xD;
        when deciding on the content of a specific release.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Post-Live support procedures should be in place or well under construction by the time the Deployment and cut-over&#xD;
        plan is actually started.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the principal document that will guide the management through system deployment. This document provides a&#xD;
    detailed schedule of events, expected project duration, persons responsible, and event dependencies required to ensure&#xD;
    successful cut-over to the new system. Deployment can impose a great deal of change and stress on end users. Therefore,&#xD;
    ensuring a smooth deployment is a key factor in gaining acceptance and high satisfaction of the overall solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The deployment team could cause serious disruption to the business possibly resulting in putting the legacy system back&#xD;
    into production.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding xsi:nil="true"/>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The deployment plan consists of textual descriptions of the issues associated with the migration to the new&#xD;
    system.&amp;nbsp; The plan may also include Gantt charts, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) charts, and&#xD;
    Critical Path Method (CPM) charts, calendars, tables, text descriptions of tasks and status graphs.&lt;br />&#xD;
