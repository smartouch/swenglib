  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Education and Training Strategy consists of the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial list of critical success factors for training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of the training needs for staff and the needs identified in other domains&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An evaluation of alternate methods for delivering the training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An approach for the development of the staff training material&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An initial roll-out plan for the delivery of education and training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The strategy should address the following three major areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        organization: staff must understand and accept new roles, responsibilities and competencies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process: staff must understand the business practices and operating principles associated with the business&#xD;
        processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT: staff must understand and be able to use any new package or system efficiently and effectively to perform their&#xD;
        work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify all staff affected by the change, training requirements for each, sequence of training, delivery methods, and&#xD;
    standards for success. The initial rollout plan should include the training of instructors, pilot classes and&#xD;
    logistical considerations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. It is recommended that the client&#xD;
    appoint one person to work with the consultant and to be responsible for all the activities concerning the development&#xD;
    of training material and the planning of the roll out.&amp;nbsp; This single point of contact will help the client:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select the right strategy and stick to it&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Give the participant training a high priority, and get the best people on board, both for the development and&#xD;
            the training&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Have a chance to find the right people who are analytical and have the necessary skills and abilities to&#xD;
            develop or present training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the system or package well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they&#xD;
            have time to digest all the information&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Check what the client's previous experience has been in training situations. Learn about the organization's culture and&#xD;
    previous reactions, and what works and what does not work in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development work must be carefully coordinated with the implementation of the Change Program. Changes in the&#xD;
    implementation should be reflected in the training material, and strict change request procedures must be put in place&#xD;
    to ensure coordination.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key risks should be presented to the client before the specification of the education material is completed. Risk&#xD;
    areas could include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Tools: Will the participants have the right tools on their desk when they have finished the training? Will&#xD;
            testing be successfully completed? Participants can quickly become disillusioned if they perceive problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Material: Has the material been targeted at the correct level? Are learning skills sufficient?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Time scales: Are the schedules realistic ? Has time been allowed for translating the material into other&#xD;
            languages ?&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the training material is changed as a result of a change in the Change Program, in the middle of rolling out the&#xD;
    classes, consider using available communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and&#xD;
    where the changes are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what is the best way&#xD;
    of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it takes longer&#xD;
    than you think!)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare&#xD;
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.The planned lengths of the&#xD;
    time for training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Successful change to an organization is dependent on how well its management and staff are equipped to operate in the&#xD;
    new environment. The degree to which the organization can quickly adapt to the new environment can depend on the&#xD;
    quality of the training material and the courses provided.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this work product is therefore to enable staff to operate effectively in the new environment by&#xD;
    providing for appropriate training and development.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Without a carefully considered &quot;going in&quot; strategy, it is difficult to produce a cohesive training package that&#xD;
        will support and fully coordinate training with the Change Program.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Agreement on a high level strategy is a major early step in building consensus around the training effort. Without&#xD;
        consensus at a high level, it is nearly impossible to build a training plan that the client can be expected to take&#xD;
        ownership of and fully support.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If many participants are involved, the roll out of education is complicated enough to need detailed planning. A&#xD;
        poor roll out will compromise acceptance of the Change Program and, in the worst case, a proportion of participants&#xD;
        will reject it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the number of participants is limited, and if they have been closely associated with the development effort, a&#xD;
    training plan may not be necessary. Participants will gradually gain most of the necessary knowledge during the&#xD;
    rollout. A comprehensive walk-through or wrap-up session may still be beneficial.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a limited number of participants, the training strategy may be to provide an initial session in basics and then on&#xD;
    the job training. One or more consultants would need to be present to help the participants with their daily tasks. An&#xD;
    introduction to the new organization and business processes will still need to be provided and the material for this&#xD;
    will need to be developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The education and training plan, which is a detailed extension of the strategy, should take into account the plans for&#xD;
    any required documentation, on-line help, on-line examples, and other support materials. The plan for the development&#xD;
    of participant training material contains the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Terminology to be used in the training material&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            A list of training topics to be covered and their initial sequence in education and training modules&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            The delivery method to be used&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            A list of support material to be developed&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Media specifications for training materials&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Standards to be used for the different types of education and training material&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Identification of development resources&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Definition of the number of instances, and the size of the box needed for the training client database&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Identification of master data and exercise data needed in the training client database&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition, the training plan should address the rollout of participant training and post change training and support.&#xD;
