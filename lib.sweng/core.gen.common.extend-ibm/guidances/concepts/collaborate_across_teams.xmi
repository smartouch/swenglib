                                        with limited collaboration between different team members, and limited integration&#xD;
                                        between different tools. The assumption is that if just everybody does his or her&#xD;
                                        job, the end result will be good..&#xD;

                        &lt;/tr>&#xD;

                &lt;/table>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Discussion&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software is produced by talented and motivated people collaborating closely. Many complex systems require the&#xD;
    collaboration of a number of stakeholders with varying skills, and the largest projects often span geographical and&#xD;
    temporal boundaries, further adding complexity to the development process. This is why people issues and collaboration&#xD;
    -- what some have referred to as the &quot;soft&quot; element of software development -- have been a primary focus in the agile&#xD;
    development community . Following this principle requires answering&amp;nbsp;many questions, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            How do we motivate people to perform at their best?&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            How do we collaborate within a co-located versus a distributed software team?&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            How do we collaborate across teams responsible for the business, software development, and IT operations?&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step in effective collaboration is to &lt;em>motivate individuals on the team to perform at their best.&lt;/em> The&#xD;
    notion of self-managed teams has gained popularity in the agile community; it is based on making a team commit to what&#xD;
    they should deliver and then providing that team&amp;nbsp;with the authority to decide on all the issues directly&#xD;
    influencing the result. When people feel that they are truly responsible for the end result, they are much more&#xD;
    motivated to do a good job. As the agile manifesto states: &quot;Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the&#xD;
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second step is to &lt;em>encourage cross-functional collaboration&lt;/em>. As Walker Royce says, &quot;software development is&#xD;
    a team sport.&quot; An iterative approach increases the need for working closely as a team. We need to break down the walls&#xD;
    that often exist between analysts, developers, and testers, and broaden the responsibilities of these roles to ensure&#xD;
    effective collaboration in an environment with fast churn. Each member needs to understand the mission and vision of&#xD;
    the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As teams grow, we need to &lt;em>provide then with effective collaborative environments&lt;/em>. These environments&#xD;
    facilitate and automate metrics collection and status reporting, and automate build management and bookkeeping around&#xD;
    configuration management. This efficiency reduces the need for meetings, which frees up team members to spend more time&#xD;
    on more productive and creative activities. These environments should also enable more effective collaboration by&#xD;
    simplifying communication, bridging gaps in place and time between various team members. Examples of such environment&#xD;
    range from shared project rooms, to networked or Web-based solutions such as Wikis or integrated development&#xD;
    environments and configuration and change management environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As software becomes more critical to core business processes, the need for effective collaboration between teams&#xD;
    increases. In most organizations the teams responsible for running the business, developing the applications, and&#xD;
    running the applications have poor communication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Our ultimate goal under this principle is &lt;em>integrated collaboration across business, software, and operation&#xD;
    teams.&lt;/em> As software becomes increasingly critical to how we run our business, we need to create close collaboration&#xD;
    between 1) the teams deciding how to run our current and future business, 2) the teams developing the supporting&#xD;
    software systems, and 3) the teams running our IT operations. In most companies, these three groups have poor&#xD;
    communication.&#xD;
