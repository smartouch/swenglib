    The key value proposition of this practice is&amp;nbsp;to elaborate an optimum architecture structure based upon key system&#xD;
    functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In preparation for the trade study and in order to support the analysis of alternatives, the key system functions are&#xD;
    identified. A key system function could be a group of system functions that can be described as one or more of the&#xD;
    following:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cohesive and/or tightly coupled.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        May be realized by a single architectural component.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Will be realized by reuse of an existing component (HW/SW).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        May be reused within the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Addressing a specific design constraint.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is always more than one way to realize a key system function, so you need to identify possible solutions for a&#xD;
    previously identified key system function. The solutions are elaborated in a team representing all relevant areas of&#xD;
    expertise. At this stage, associated stakeholder requirements need to be identified and taken into consideration.&#xD;
    Candidate solutions may take into consideration previously developed hardware and software components,&#xD;
    non-developmental items, and COTS hardware and software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of this process, the solutions identified for each key system function are merged to define the equipment&#xD;
    breakdown structure. It is assumed that the initial key system functions were independent. Thus, the final merged&#xD;
    solution is the preferred solution based upon the assessment criteria for the complete architecture. It will be the&#xD;
    basis of the subsequent architectural design activities. These design decisions are captured in the Trade Study Report&#xD;
    along with any resulting design constraints.&#xD;
&lt;/p></problem>
  <application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start with the main workflow and understand each activity you need to perform, by reading the associated tasks. Shift&#xD;
    your focus on the central work product produced at this stage, which is the Trade Study Report.&#xD;
&lt;/p></application>
