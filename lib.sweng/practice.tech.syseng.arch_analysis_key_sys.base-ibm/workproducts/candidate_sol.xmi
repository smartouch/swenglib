  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is always more than one way to realize a key system function. Candidate solutions should take into consideration&#xD;
    previously developed hardware and software components, non-developmental items, and COTS hardware and software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to limit the scope of the trade study, the list of candidate solutions should be limited to those that are&#xD;
    feasible (cost, schedule), and low risk. Eliminate candidates that don't satisfy the associated system requirements for&#xD;
    the key system function. Keep the list of candidates as small as possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this artifact is to define&amp;nbsp;the set of alternative solutions that will be considered in the trade study&#xD;
for realizing a key system function.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact it would not be possible to perform a trade study.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>The selected representation option for this artifact will depend upon the representation option chosen for the Trade Study&#xD;
