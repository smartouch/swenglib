  <mainDescription>Each key system function is analyzed with regard to its realization. At this stage, associated stakeholder requirements&#xD;
need to be identified and taken into consideration. Typically, first-cut design decisions are made: &quot;Buy or build?&quot; Should&#xD;
the key system function be realized as a COTS component or developed internally? Based on these preconditions, possible&#xD;
solutions then are identified in a team representing all relevant areas of expertise. The task ends with a set of agreed&#xD;
alternative solutions for the chosen key system function.</mainDescription>
