    Runtime analysis should be performed after the implementation has passed the developer tests. For runtime execution of&#xD;
    the component to yield accurate results, care should be taken to prepare the component satisfactorily so that no&#xD;
    anomalous results occur as a by-product of errors in implementation, compilation or linking.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You will also need to prepare any framework or supporting tools required to execute the component. In some cases this&#xD;
    may mean creating driver or harness code to support execution of the component; in other cases it may mean&#xD;
    instrumenting the component so that external support tools can observe and possibly control the components behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having prepared both the component and the environment it will be observed in, you can now begin to execute the&#xD;
    component through the chosen scenario. Dependent on the techniques and tools employed, this step may be performed&#xD;
    largely unattended or may offer (or even require) ongoing attention as the scenario progresses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look for failures or anomalies in the expected behavior, even though the developer tests passed successfully. Note any&#xD;
    observations you make or impressions you have that you think might relate to the anomalous behavior.&amp;nbsp; Take your&#xD;
    findings and begin to investigate the underlying fault or root cause of each failure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document failures in a reproduceable way, including how to set up and use analysis tools to re-create the failures or&#xD;
    anomalies.&#xD;
