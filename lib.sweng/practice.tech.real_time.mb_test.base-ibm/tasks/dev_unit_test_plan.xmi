  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task creates the unit test plan or suite based upon the context of the model being built in the current activity.&#xD;
    The model could be the Platform Independent Model or the Platform Specific Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>It is very important to understand how the piece of the model that you are designing is expected to work in the overall&#xD;
system, so that you can design accurate tests for the model.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="__DovkOCIEd-aE9U0mRj03A" name="Create test plan organization" guid="__DovkOCIEd-aE9U0mRj03A">
    <sectionDescription>Define the organization structure you will use in the test plan i.e. chapters, sections, index, etc.&amp;nbsp;</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>You should create a unit test plan using the test plan work product guidance and template, if desired.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind&#xD;
that you are designing a test plan for a system component and not the system as a whole.&amp;nbsp; This test plan will be used&#xD;
during the implementation phase of design.&amp;nbsp; Each test case should include preconditions, data, test flow, and expected&#xD;
results.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>It is important to establish traceability from the test case to the requirement as soon as you write the test case.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of a unit test plan&amp;nbsp;is to&amp;nbsp;give guidelines to the modelers and testers on how to properly test a&#xD;
    component during the&amp;nbsp;Object Analysis&amp;nbsp;phase of development.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
