    <sectionDescription>Select a set of Test Cases to develop into detailed, executable Test Suite. Sketch an outline of the Test Suite as a&#xD;
logical sequence of steps. Review the data requirements of the Test Case, and determine if existing data sets are&#xD;
sufficient, or if you need to develop new test data for this Test Suite. Examine Supporting Requirements that apply to this&#xD;
Test Case, and note where they affect the expected results of a step. Develop a detailed, procedural Test Suite based on&#xD;
your design. Use a request-response style that declares an exact input, and expects an exact output.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Select an implementation technique for this design. At a minimum, determine if the Test Suite will be manual or automated.&#xD;
If the Test Case is well understood, it's best to implement an automated Test Script without first writing a manual&#xD;
procedure. However, if the Test Case is new or novel, writing a manual Test Script can help validate the design of the test&#xD;
and aid collaboration with other team members.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Analyze the results of the execution.&amp;nbsp; You should always document any defects that a test finds, and decide whether to&#xD;
immediately repair, deferred repair, or ignore deviations from the expected results.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this task is to ensure that the proper system functionality remains and that the optimization goals have&#xD;
    been met after the optimization was performed.&#xD;
