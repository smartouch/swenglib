  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process begins with some overall project planning.&amp;nbsp; Then the iterative development cycle (IDC), also referred&#xD;
    to as the microcycle, carries the project forward.&amp;nbsp; The IDC is an incremental approach, in which the system is&#xD;
    developed as a series of builds of increasing capability and completeness.&amp;nbsp; The system (referred to as the&#xD;
    &quot;prototype&quot; even though it is fully production quality code) is constructed incrementally, with new builds adding new&#xD;
    system-level capabilities to the increasingly complete system.&amp;nbsp; The advantage of such an incremental approach are&#xD;
    well documented in the literature, and include higher quality, lower cost of quality, and even reduced development&#xD;
    time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In&amp;nbsp;the Full Spiral&amp;nbsp;lifecycle, there is a quick initial analysis to identify the set of use cases (and provide&#xD;
    a 1-paragraph mission statement), but the use cases are not detailed until later. This means that software work begins&#xD;
    before all of the use cases are fully specified. In fact, the use cases are only detailed within the spiral during&#xD;
    which they will be realized.&#xD;
