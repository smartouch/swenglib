  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reuse of existing IT assets within an SOA has two components: (1) identification of reusable assets&amp;nbsp;and the&#xD;
    Capabilities that they offer, and (2) determination of how these assets will be used to realize services that have been&#xD;
    selected for exposure.&amp;nbsp; The first component of this sub-process is performed in this task.&amp;nbsp; Realization&#xD;
    decisions are made within a Service Realization initiative, and are beyond the scope of the present discussion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, candidate services and flows are identified using Existing Asset Analysis.&amp;nbsp; The assets examined can&#xD;
    include existing systems,&amp;nbsp;such as packaged or custom applications, and&amp;nbsp;industry standards, models, and&#xD;
    components. Technical constraints related to existing systems&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be evaluated as early as possible for&#xD;
    risk management purposes.&amp;nbsp;Because of this requirement, the related task, &lt;em>Perform Technical Feasibility&#xD;
    Exploration&lt;/em>,&amp;nbsp;is often&amp;nbsp;performed as soon as possible after or during Existing Asset Analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>This can be a major workflow in itself.&amp;nbsp; One useful approach is to build a context diagram that establishes the&#xD;
functional boundary between the&amp;nbsp;to-be SOA system and the actors outside that system.&amp;nbsp; Then, examine the current&#xD;
application portfolio to identify the business processes, applications, and data flows that lie within that boundary.</sectionDescription>

        Understand the business functions supported by each application.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&#xD;
        Typically a business function can be mapped to an activity within a business process [Business Design].&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Record attributes of existing applications in terms of technologies used, architectural styles, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Identify applications that perform common services.&#xD;
