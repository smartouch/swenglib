  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task produces a goal-service model -- an allocation of candidate services (or existing services) to business&#xD;
    goals.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the work product slot of [Business Requirements] is fulfilled by Business Goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This technique begins with generalized statements of business goals, with subsequent decomposition into sub-goals that&#xD;
    must be met in order to fulfill&amp;nbsp;each higher level goal. This eventually leads to a level of decomposition that&#xD;
    supports the identification of services associated with the sub-goals. During this process, KPIs are identified and&#xD;
    collected along with the metrics that will be used to measure, monitor, and verify the degree of success in actually&#xD;
    achieving the goals.&amp;nbsp; Finally, candidate services and services are allocated to the goals and sub-goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Task steps &lt;code>Identify business goals and sub-divide into sub-goals&lt;/code> and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code>Identify Key Performance Indicators and&#xD;
    metrics for sub-goals&lt;/code> are optional.&amp;nbsp; They do not need to be performed if a goal hierarchy with associated KPIs&#xD;
    and metrics already exists when the task begins.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    representations of a goal-service model.&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failure to clearly define business goals will make it difficult to determine if proposed candidate services are&#xD;
    business-aligned and appropriate for use in an SOA based initiative.&amp;nbsp;Because Goal-Service Modeling can also&#xD;
    identify (not simply validate) candidate services, failure to create this work product can lead to gaps in the service&#xD;
    portfolio. These factors can result in additional effort and cost due to the creation of unnecessary services, or&#xD;
    reduced success of the SOA based solution due to gaps in the service portfolio.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because&amp;nbsp;the Goal-Service Model is important to defining the scope of other service identification activities,&#xD;
    failure to create it could result in unnecessary effort being spent in other activities, or gaps in the output from&#xD;
    those activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although the Goal-Service Model is considered important, if not essential, for a majority of SOA based initiatives,&#xD;
    there could be occasional circumstances where the focus is narrowed to the creation of services for common technology&#xD;
    functions which might not appear to be easily aligned with specific business goals. It is worth considering that, even&#xD;
    in these scenarios, the Goal-Service Model can be used to document goals related to the Business of IT.&#xD;

    As the Business Analyst, identify necessary business goals [Business Requirements]&amp;nbsp;and decompose them&amp;nbsp;into&#xD;
    hierarchies of sub-goals that must be met in order to satisfy the top-level goals. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/defining_business_goals_4DC7191A.html&quot; guid=&quot;_s59O0FIQEd6lNtylJFsPIg&quot;>Guideline: Defining Business Goals&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;provides advice for defining goals and&#xD;

    As the Business Analyst, identify Key&amp;nbsp;Performance Indicators and Metrics for your goals.&amp;nbsp;Document these as&#xD;
    supplementary portions of your Business Goal descriptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>KPI's&lt;/b>: KPIs are used to determine how well a business is meeting its goals, or to assess the level of&#xD;
    performance of business processes. For example, for the goal &lt;em>increase revenue&lt;/em>, a specific KPI could be &lt;em>increase&#xD;
revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year&lt;/em>. This provides a specific way to determine if the goal has been met. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Metrics:&lt;/b> Metrics identify the type of measurements that need to be collected to assess the state of the KPIs.&#xD;
    For a KPI such as &lt;em>increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year&lt;/em>, a metric could be &lt;em>record the revenue from all&#xD;
    revenue generating transactions&lt;/em>. Measurements would then need to be taken of each relevant transaction, across all&#xD;
    systems that support those transactions. An implication of this is that all of the individual measurements dictated by&#xD;
    the metric would need to be aggregated and reported in a meaningful way so that it can be determined if the related KPI&#xD;
has been met. &lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the&amp;nbsp;identified business goals,&amp;nbsp;we now assign any candidate services in the project service portfolio to&#xD;
    the goals they support. It is also possible to identify new candidate services where goals or sub-goals exist that have&#xD;
    no supporting services. The method used to assign services to goals will depend on your choice of representation for&#xD;
    the service model, and therefore the representation of the goal-service model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During decomposition of goals into sub-goals and KPIs, the question will arise as to when we&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;stop&#xD;
    this decomposition process. As already mentioned, goal analysis can stop once sub-goals have been identified to the&#xD;
    point at which services that can fulfill those sub-goals can be identified. If new services are identified, update the&#xD;
    categorized service portfolio in the service model. For each sub-goal, identify the services needed to fulfill the&#xD;
    sub-goal.&#xD;
