    This task uses &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.bus.use_case_driven_business_modeling.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_uc_realization_B9B77CA3.html&quot; guid=&quot;_NFkXsGDYEd6EnMwJEA4c6A&quot;>business use-case realizations&lt;/a> as input and identifies a set of candidate services&#xD;
    that are included in the project candidate service portfolio. These candidate services might yet require additional&#xD;
    refinement, however the steps included here provide an effective manner in which to produce an initial set of service&#xD;
    candidates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case realization describes interactions between actors and business-relevant elements, to deliver&#xD;
    something of measurable value to one or more of the actors.&amp;nbsp; As is true with business processes, business use&#xD;
    cases -- and their associated realizations -- can be defined at various levels of detail within the business (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/decomposing_business_processes_4B6C7EDB.html&quot; guid=&quot;_5Mi1gEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Guideline: Decomposing Business Processes&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp; At the highest level, the business&#xD;
    elements involved in the realization might be business domains.&amp;nbsp; The next level of detail might involve&#xD;
    interacting functional areas.&amp;nbsp; Going yet another level down, the interacting elements might be business subsystems&#xD;
    or business workers within a functional area (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/functional_area_analysis_9B1F96D5.html&quot; guid=&quot;_fk1woEo1Ed6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Concept: Functional Area Analysis&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analysis performed at each of these levels of&amp;nbsp;detail can be valuable,&amp;nbsp;because they will result in operations&#xD;
    that represent different levels of entry into the overall business behavior.&amp;nbsp; For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations&amp;nbsp;discovered at the level of interacting business domains might represent initiation of large-scale&#xD;
        business processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations discovered at the level of interacting functional areas might represent initiation of significant&#xD;
        sub-processes that are wholly owned by a functional area&#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operations discovered at the level of interacting business subsystems might represent entry points into leaf-level&#xD;
        sub-processes, which are the gateways to IT system use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the work product slot of [Business Design] is filled by Business Model, which includes business use case&#xD;
    descriptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying candidate services from business use case realizations is one of several schemes that complement each&#xD;
    other during candidate services identification. Omitting any of the methods increases the risk that some candidate&#xD;
    services will not be discovered.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For maximum benefit, this task&amp;nbsp;needs to&amp;nbsp;be performed using a business use case realization model [Business&#xD;
    Design]&amp;nbsp;that is decomposed such that the operations involved in the lowest level of realizations can themselves be&#xD;
    mapped, either singularly or collectively,&amp;nbsp;to system use cases.&amp;nbsp; If this degree of decomposition has not been&#xD;
    achieved, then&amp;nbsp;perform business use case realization modeling techniques to achieve it.&amp;nbsp; Such techniques are&#xD;
    beyond the scope of this practice.&amp;nbsp; They are addressed, for example, in the IBM Practice Library's Use-Case-Driven&#xD;
    Business Modeling practice.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, create a candidate service for each operation defined on each business&amp;nbsp;element that is involved in the&#xD;
    realization. There exists a distinct&amp;nbsp;parallel here to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.soma.service_identification.base-ibm/tasks/identify_candidate_services_from_business_processes_54D9E0FA.html&quot; guid=&quot;_e9TgEGTPEd6EKfYvqjfiMA&quot;>Task: Identify Candidate Services from Business Processes&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;where individual&#xD;
    tasks in a process model are identified as candidate services.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This fairly direct connection between the business model and the service model allows for not only services that can be&#xD;
    seen to support the business needs, but by having less transformations between the expression of business needs and the&#xD;
    solution, you can more effectively respond to change in the Business Use Case or&amp;nbsp;Business Models. Another important&#xD;
    aspect is that because the Business Use Case model also includes the Business Goals that are driving the business, it is now&#xD;
    much easier to actually identify the alignment between Services and Goals. For example, it is now possible to list, for&#xD;
    any Capability, all the Business Goals to which it contributes. For any Business Goal we can list the Services actually&#xD;
    deployed in our IT organization that contribute to the goal, by following the connection from Capability to&#xD;
    ServiceInterface.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases the set of operations defined in the business use case realization might more correctly reflect a&#xD;
    &lt;em>conversation&lt;/em> between parties related to a single service than it does to a set of distinct services. In such a&#xD;
    case, the operations might be aggregated onto a single service specification (as shown in Figure 2). The drawback to this&#xD;
    approach is that it requires more detailed analysis and understanding of the use case realization, and the role of&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;business elements&amp;nbsp;within it, to identify this as a requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Conversation&lt;/em> means that often the actual completion of a service requires multiple interactions between&#xD;
    parties.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you&amp;nbsp;examine the &lt;code>Place Order&lt;/code> service, you might actually find that this is a complex&#xD;
set of interactions including acknowledgments, shipping notices, negations (for example if items are unavailable), and so on. &lt;/p></sectionDescription>
