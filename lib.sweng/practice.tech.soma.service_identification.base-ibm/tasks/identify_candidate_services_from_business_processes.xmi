  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the objectives of IT-centric SOA is to effectively automate the business.&amp;nbsp; With this in mind, it is clear&#xD;
    that &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_6DC80DFA.html&quot; guid=&quot;_zjPQgIqmEd64Ytrb_zySHw&quot;>business process&lt;/a> models are a source of ideas for identifying IT services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Service identification normally is performed using a process model that is decomposed to the level of business tasks&#xD;
    that can be mapped to system use cases (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_70D1DA00.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0XDGMEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>Concept: Business Process Decomposition&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp; Using this decomposed model,&#xD;
    candidate services at many levels of granularity can be identified:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that&amp;nbsp;coordinate the execution of full business processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that&amp;nbsp;coordinate the execution of sub-processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that coordinate the execution of system use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Services that perform specific, limited functions, such as services that are responsible for a specific business&#xD;
        calculation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of these service types has value.&amp;nbsp; Their discovered instances are viable candidate services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the work product slot of [Business Design] is filled by Business Model, which includes business process&#xD;
    descriptions.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>A decomposed business process model [Business Design]&amp;nbsp;is a necessary input to this technique.&amp;nbsp; If such a model&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>This is the opposite case from the previous task -- the process has not been decomposed.&amp;nbsp; If this process is relevant&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>As was mentioned in the Main Description of this task, business process models yield appropriate services at many levels of&#xD;
the decomposed process.&amp;nbsp; Don't overlook higher-level services that map to the process itself, or to its major&#xD;
sub-processes.&amp;nbsp; Those will be the gateways into the overall web of choreographed services that will realize those&#xD;
major aspects of business functionality.</sectionDescription>

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying candidate services from business processes is one of several schemes that complement each other during&#xD;
    candidate services identification.&amp;nbsp; Omitting any of the methods increases the risk that some candidate services&#xD;
    will not be discovered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This particular technique provides a valuable coverage check on the results obtained from identifying candidate&#xD;
    services&amp;nbsp;using business functional models.&amp;nbsp; The process tasks that are allocated to functional areas during&#xD;
    business process decomposition&amp;nbsp;are expected to&amp;nbsp;be essentially identical to the business functions that are&#xD;
    allocated to the functional areas during&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/functional_area_analysis_9B1F96D5.html&quot; guid=&quot;_fk1woEo1Ed6D_7XK49c0nw&quot;>functional area analysis&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; So, the two techniques&amp;nbsp;are expected&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;yield similar sets of large-grained service operations.&amp;nbsp; If this is not the case, this indicates that&#xD;
    either the business functional model or the process model is incomplete.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to identify candidate services from business processes.</purpose>
