    As&amp;nbsp;is described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.tech.soma.service_identification.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_rule_analysis_96BC2841.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Wue0wGTgEd6EKfYvqjfiMA&quot;>Concept: Business Rule Analysis&lt;/a>, larger businesses increasingly use Business Rules&#xD;
    Management Systems (BRMSes) to author and externalize their business rules.&amp;nbsp; BRMSes can automate the creation of&#xD;
    access layers, such as Web services or Java&amp;trade;beans, for accessing the business rules programmatically.&amp;nbsp; In such an&#xD;
    environment, the task related to identifying candidate services largely devolves to the IT staff working with the&#xD;
    business analysts to document the services that the BRMS automatically generates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations that have not yet adopted a BRMS will need to use a more conventional approach&amp;nbsp;for identifying&#xD;
    candidate services from business rules.&amp;nbsp; The steps in this task largely are intended for the use of such&#xD;
    organizations.&amp;nbsp; The final step -- Update candidate service portfolio and service hierarchy -- is valid for&#xD;
    organizations using a BRMS, as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules and policies that are subject to change&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;be externalized to reduce opportunities for&#xD;
    error.&amp;nbsp; Service enablement and using business rules engines are two approaches to externalization.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules fall into two broad categories:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Inference rules&lt;/strong> (IF this, THEN that), which&amp;nbsp; are commonly stateless rules that are&#xD;
        encountered during the execution of procedural applications; and&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Reactive rules&lt;/strong>, which are triggered by specific events,&amp;nbsp;run if a specific condition is valid,&#xD;
        and which perform a specific action -- such as a database modification.&amp;nbsp; Reactive rules commonly are executed&#xD;
        by a system that monitors its surrounding conditions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As an example, when a particular item in a grocery&#xD;
        store falls below a certain number of on-shelf items, that might trigger a restocking order.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this step, focus on reactive rules.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;em>triggering event&lt;/em>, &lt;em>transition condition&lt;/em>, and&#xD;
    &lt;em>action taken&lt;/em> need to be documented.&amp;nbsp; If the candidate service is selected later for exposure, these three&#xD;
    items will need to be addressed during the implementation of the service that realizes the rule.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
