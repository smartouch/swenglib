    A schedule allows you to order, group, and run tests. With schedules, you can run tests remotely, establish the order&#xD;
    of tests (sequential, random, or weighted order), run tests at a specific rate, or specify the number of times a given&#xD;
    test runs. You can also use schedules to run tests against specified builds.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Performance Tester provides a convenient wizard for creating schedules. To create a performance&#xD;
    schedule, right-click your project and then click &lt;strong>New &amp;gt; Performance Schedule&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Performance Schedule Wizard, enter the name of the schedule and click &lt;strong>Finish&lt;/strong>. At this point, a&#xD;
    new schedule with one user group appears. User groups allow you to create logical groupings by using various&#xD;
    characteristics representing various types of users on your system. In order to achieve a more realistic distribution&#xD;
    of users, you may want to create various groups to represent different categories, such as &lt;i>buyers&lt;/i>,&#xD;
    &lt;i>sellers&lt;/i>, &lt;i>users checking on the status of an order&lt;/i>, or &lt;i>browsers&lt;/i>. The user group types will be&#xD;
    determined by the characteristic of the users of your system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Performance Schedule Wizard, you can also easily add tests. With the schedule you just created open, right-click&#xD;
    the user group and select &lt;strong>Add &amp;gt; Test&lt;/strong>. In the Select Performance Test window, select the test you&#xD;
    want to add to your schedule. You can also alternate start times for users in the User Load section of the schedule by&#xD;
    selecting the check box &lt;strong>Add a delay between starting each user&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, when you are building a schedule, you will want to achieve a random arrival delay with every transaction.&#xD;
    You will also want to prevent authentication rejections by ramping up user numbers slowly, or by starting with random&#xD;
    delays. You can, for example, start with 1 to 4 users per second and ramp-up, or start with 10 to 20 with random delays&#xD;
    over several minutes. Finally, when you are building your schedule, make sure that the test runs long enough to get&#xD;
    steady state results. This can be achieved by making the workload last a long time relative to ramp-up.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
