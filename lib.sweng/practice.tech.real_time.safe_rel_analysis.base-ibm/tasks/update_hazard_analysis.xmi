  <mainDescription>The hazard analysis is a key document for safety critical systems as it combines the description of the hazards, the level&#xD;
of risk, system faults that can lead to the hazard, and the control measures all together in a single view. The Fault is a&#xD;
non-compliance of the system that can lead to the identified hazard. The severity is a measure of how bad the hazard is (an&#xD;
arbitrary scale of 1-10 is used often used). The Risk is a value computed by the likelihood multiplied by the severity of&#xD;
the occurrence. This task keeps the hazard analysis up to date, re-performing fault tree and failure modes and effect&#xD;
analyses as appropriate.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>As requirements change or design decisions are made, these can increase or decrease either safety or reliability (or both).&#xD;
Those changes must be examined to see if they impact or even invalidate the existing hazard analysis.</sectionDescription>
