  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An FMEA is most often used in a bottom-up approach - that is detailed failures are examined to determine their ultimate&#xD;
    consequences. In contrast, Fault Tree Analysis is more commonly used in a top-down approach, beginning with hazards and&#xD;
    then determining what faults elicit them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    FMEA and FTA are used in both reliability engineering and safety-critical system engineering.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this work product is to capture qualitative and quantitative data about failures and their consequences for&#xD;
reliability and safety engineering.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>This product is one of the primary means for capturing and analyzing system reliability. Without the product, or its&#xD;
equivalent, this analysis will be difficult to perform.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This work product is not needed to systems that do not have significant reliability requirements or needs.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
