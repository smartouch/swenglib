    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examine the iteration plan, and identify the scope and objectives of the plan. It is useful to supplement this&#xD;
    examination with informal discussions with key project staff (such as the project manager, software architect, and&#xD;
    customer sponsor). These meetings will often highlight concerns more explicitly than documented in the plan. Attending&#xD;
    iteration kickoff meetings also provides useful information.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The mission is the governing principle that guides the test effort during a given time period. Testing resources are&#xD;
    typically limited, so the challenge is to balance given testing resource constraints with the quality validation needs&#xD;
    of the software development effort. Gain an initial understanding at a strategic level of the expectations of the&#xD;
    software development team. You should mainly be concerned with the expectations of the project manager, software&#xD;
    architect, and lead system analysts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not a terribly useful practice to consider objectives and scope in isolation from the rest of the project team.&#xD;
    Better is team ownership of product quality, and as such you should include relevant stakeholders from the rest of the&#xD;
    project team when deciding what testing is important. You should consider team members that fill the following roles as&#xD;
    important stakeholders: project manager, architect, system analyst, and integrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, the presentation format will suit being formal, with the stakeholders convening as a review board and&#xD;
    requiring significant preparation in advance. In other cases, &quot;brown-bag lunches&quot; may be appropriate, or individual&#xD;
    interviews with each stakeholder. There are good and bad points for each approach: choose the format that best suits&#xD;
    your needs in the context of the current project environment.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_iv514H97Ed27jvxgc9zKew" name="Formulate Mission Statement" guid="_iv514H97Ed27jvxgc9zKew">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mission statements are helpful in providing focus to a team, especially in situations where the team is faced with many&#xD;
    possible choices. Test teams without an evaluation mission often consider that they simply test: this provides little&#xD;
    guidance when difficult choices must be made regarding the best focus for testing within time or resource constraints.&#xD;
    A mission statement distills the essence of the current work objective, and provides a mantra to keep the team focused&#xD;
    on the right things.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Formulate a mission statement that can be used by the test team. Do not make it too complex or incorporate too many&#xD;
    conflicting ideas: The best mission statements are simple, short and sweet; and, in most situations where a decision&#xD;
    needs to be made between possible options, the mission will make it obvious what choice the team should make.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ideas for mission statements that you might adopt for a given iteration:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Find as many bugs as possible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Find important problems fast&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assess perceived quality risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Advise about perceived project risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Advise about perceived quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Certify a standard&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Verify a specification (requirements, design, or product claims)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Satisfy stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fulfill process mandates&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Looking through this list, it should occur to you that many missions are mutually exclusive. For example, if my mission&#xD;
    is to &quot;find important problems fast&quot;, I likely will not be able to &quot;verify a specification&quot;: To successfully achieve&#xD;
    one mission often negates other possible missions, and requires a different supporting test approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test teams that try to satisfy too many evaluation missions often get into trouble, encountering ongoing conflict in&#xD;
    their work. Note also that you can choose or reconsider your evaluation mission in each iteration: it is natural for&#xD;
    the mission to alter over time, based on the context of the current work effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_kR83cH97Ed27jvxgc9zKew" name="Identify Test Deliverables" guid="_kR83cH97Ed27jvxgc9zKew">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Certain work products are deliverables that are important to one or more stakeholders. Other work products are&#xD;
    necessary parts of the test effort and, while important to the test team, they are of little interest to those same&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Give some thought to the minimal set of useful deliverables for the test effort. Do not list all of the work products;&#xD;
    only list those that give direct, tangible benefit to a stakeholder, and those by which you want the success of the&#xD;
    test effort to be measured. You might need to adjust your initial list to accommodate the needs of the stakeholders,&#xD;
    but you will need to take a proactive role in encouraging the deliverables to be kept useful and manageable.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_l_7cMH97Ed27jvxgc9zKew" name="Gain Stakeholder Agreement" guid="_l_7cMH97Ed27jvxgc9zKew">
    <sectionDescription>In a similar manner to the earlier steps, you should obtain agreement from those same stakeholders that the evaluation&#xD;
mission and its associated supporting aspects are appropriate for this iteration. Again, give thought to the appropriate&#xD;
format for presenting the mission and gaining required approvals. Choose the format that best suits your needs in the&#xD;
context of the current project environment.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to: &#xD;

        Negotiate the most effective use of testing resources for each iteration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
