  <sections xmi:id="_DXTKAHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Determine Nature of Testing" guid="_DXTKAHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Identify the main factors driving the test effort. Look at the list of test motivators for some of the similar types of&#xD;
projects, and find the common ones. Understand the development organization, the team specific responsibilities, and how&#xD;
they interface with each other. Capture the main focus and scope for the teams that are supposed to follow the test&#xD;
process, and review these with all of the interested teams (and with the main stakeholders of the development&#xD;
organization). Define the test areas and the test teams responsible for each of them.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_E0uxUHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Ensure Test Process Supports Testing Context" guid="_E0uxUHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Start with the current test process, and review it against the agreed upon testing context. Perform a gap analysis and&#xD;
identify the missing process guidance for the main test areas: test levels and test types. Fill in these gaps by providing&#xD;
the necessary support based on the previous experience of the main test experts in your organization, and make sure that&#xD;
each test team has enough process guidance to do their specific test work.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_GLKYwHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Capture Test Process Configuration in Test Plan" guid="_GLKYwHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Create test plan templates for all of the test areas identified in the previous steps. Address the specific concerns for&#xD;
each test type and level by providing specialized sections. For each section, describe their scope and goals, and provide&#xD;
examples. Define a naming convention that will enable the creation, the maintenance, and the review of the artifacts that&#xD;
will be produced during the test-related projects. For example, include the iteration identifier, the test level, and the&#xD;
test type in the name of the test plan. Define the lifecycle of each type of artifact produced during a test cycle, and its&#xD;
review and approval process.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_HtDpUHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Review Test Process Configuration with Test Team" guid="_HtDpUHd8Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Review the test plan templates and the related process guidance with each test team. For each test team, focus on the test&#xD;
areas that they are responsible for. Capture their comments, and maintain a list with all of the issues that need to be&#xD;
addressed (either in the current test cycle, or for the next projects). Provide the tools that will enable an easy way to&#xD;
provide feedback, and track the process-related change requests and improvements.</sectionDescription>
