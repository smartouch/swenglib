    Good sources for test motivators include requirements, change requests, risk lists, use cases, and so on.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examine the iteration plan, and identify the specific items that will govern the plan, and the key deliverables by&#xD;
    which the execution of the plan will be measured. Key elements you should examine include: Risk lists, Change Request&#xD;
    lists, Requirements sets, Use Cases lists, UML Models, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is useful to supplement this examination by attending iteration kickoff meetings. If these are not already planned,&#xD;
    organize one for the test team that invites key management and software development resources (for example, project&#xD;
    manager, software architect, and development team leads).&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_lgbvUHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Gather and Examine Related Information" guid="_lgbvUHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having examined the iteration plan, look initially for tangible and clearly defined elements that would be good&#xD;
    candidates for assessment. Examine the details behind the work to be done, including new work, change requests, and so&#xD;
    on. Study the risks that will be addressed by the plan to understand clearly what the potential impact of the risk is,&#xD;
    and what must be done to address it (mitigate, transfer, eliminate, and so on).&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_ok-eYHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Identify Candidate Motivators" guid="_ok-eYHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the understanding that you have gained of the iteration plan, identify potential sources for things that will&#xD;
    motivate the test effort. Motivation may come from one of any number of sources: an individual work product, a set of&#xD;
    work products, an event or activity, or the absence of any of these things. Sources might include: Risk List, Change&#xD;
    Requests, Requirements Set, Use Cases, UML Models, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each source, examine the detail for potential motivators. If you cannot find a lot of detail about it, or you are&#xD;
    unfamiliar with the motivation source, it may be useful to discuss the items with the analyst and management staff,&#xD;
    usually by starting with the project manager or lead system analysts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you examine the information and discuss it with the relevant staff, enumerate a list of candidate test motivators.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_rK-3UHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Determine Quality Risks" guid="_rK-3UHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the list of candidate test motivators, consider each motivator in terms of the potential for quality risks. This&#xD;
    will help you to better understand the relevant importance of each candidate, and may expose other candidate motivators&#xD;
    that are missing from the list.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many different dimensions of quality risk, and it is possible that a single motivator may highlight the&#xD;
    potential for risk in multiple categories. Highlight the potential quality risks against each candidate motivator, and&#xD;
    indicate the likelihood and impact of the risk being encountered.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_uYnQ8Hd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Prioritize the List of Test Motivators" guid="_uYnQ8Hd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the list of candidate motivators and their quality risk information, determine the relative importance of the&#xD;
    motivators. Determine the motivators that can be addressed in the current iteration (you may want to retain the list of&#xD;
    remaining candidates for subsequent iterations).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the motivator list, documenting it as appropriate. This may be as part of the iteration test plan, in a database&#xD;
    or spreadsheet, or as a list contained within some other work product. It is useful to briefly describe why the&#xD;
    motivator is important, and what aspects of quality risk it will help to address.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_1K1LoHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Evaluate and Verify Motivators" guid="_1K1LoHd4Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those&#xD;
    team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use checklists to verify that&#xD;
    quality and completeness are good enough.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people who perform the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input review your interim work. Do this&#xD;
    while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate your work&#xD;
    against the key input work products to make sure that you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It may be&#xD;
    useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
