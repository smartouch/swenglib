  <sections xmi:id="_BekjQHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Align Test Approach with Test Mission and Objectives" guid="_BekjQHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss the test mission with the development team. After gaining initial agreement on the test mission, goals, and&#xD;
    specific objectives, define the test approach by outlining this information in the test plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_HwmiAHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Define Test Scope and Goals" guid="_HwmiAHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Based on the agreed upon mission and test motivators, define the test scope for a particular test iteration. Test scoping&#xD;
on the iteration level should address both test type(s) and test level(s), and the technical boundaries. The goals must be&#xD;
measurable and clearly defined.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_RCQ6oHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Define Testing Risks and Contingencies" guid="_RCQ6oHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document testing risks and contingencies for risk mitigation in the test plan. If your risk planning is part of a&#xD;
    larger risk management effort, coordinate testing risks with the risk analysis, design, and mitigation processes of the&#xD;
    project manager. Ensure that test-related risk items are accurately traced to requirements and testing assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_fPwJwID4Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w" name="Outline Test Cases and Define Priorities and Dependencies" guid="_fPwJwID4Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w">
    <sectionDescription>Define an outline of all test cases and test activities to be executed, in line with the goal and scope. Prioritize them&#xD;
based on the identified motivators, and the risks driving the current test effort.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_1Qa5sID6Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w" name="Define Test Configurations" guid="_1Qa5sID6Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using previously identified test configurations, define the test configurations needed for this iteration given the&#xD;
    scope constraints and priorities. If no existent configuration matches your needs, start with a description of the&#xD;
    software architecture, and focus on the deployment aspects for defining a new test environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_D_p_8Hd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Define Schedule and Entry and Exit Criteria" guid="_D_p_8Hd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>Develop a schedule for the test effort. Include specific entry and exit criteria for the development cycle. You may also&#xD;
find it useful to begin detailing work breakdown structures for the testing approach, and capture this in your test plan.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_UwYyMHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw" name="Create and Integrate Plans" guid="_UwYyMHd7Edyqd9oUl_5ulw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Create iteration test plans as needed. Ensure that your test plan reflects the test planning approach captured on a&#xD;
    detailed level in the iteration test plans. As the test planning progresses, capture your planning decisions in a test&#xD;
    asset registry or repository that is capable of maintaining test asset dependencies among different test plans (master,&#xD;
    iteration, level, and type).&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_Q7iyYID6Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w" name="Review Test Plan with Stakeholders" guid="_Q7iyYID6Ed2t7K9nV0TJ8w">
    <sectionDescription>Review the test plan with all of the stakeholders, and get agreement on all of its elements. Focus on finding a balance&#xD;
between the testing resources and the scope of the current testing effort, based on the identified risks and priorities.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>Test planning is based on the test plan and test iteration plan. The test plan can be used as a master plan. From the&#xD;
iteration test plan, the test scope and goals, the test approach, the test entry and exit criteria, and test needs and&#xD;
dependencies are defined, as well as the identification of risks and issues with associated contingency plans to address&#xD;
them.</purpose>
