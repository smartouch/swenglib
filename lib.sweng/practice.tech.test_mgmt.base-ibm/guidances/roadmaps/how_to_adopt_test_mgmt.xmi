    How to adopt this practice&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here's one possible scenario for adopting this practice. You may want to add, change, or&amp;nbsp;remove steps to design an&#xD;
    adoption roadmap more suitable to your environment. Hiring a consultant experienced in&amp;nbsp;this area&amp;nbsp;will also&#xD;
    speed your adoption of the practice and help avoid common pitfalls.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Educate your team about&amp;nbsp;the Test Management practice. Courses and presentations are available (see the&#xD;
        Additional Information section in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.test_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/practices/test_mgmt_3B4405AF.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_8Ii2gB4-Ed2dpYr1Fj8e9Q&quot;>Test Management&lt;/a>).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have the team review the material in this practice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform a gap analysis between your current practices and the newly proposed one. Focus on problem areas. Try to&#xD;
        distinguish between real differences and mere terminology mismatches.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify extension points and extend this practice to reflect any important requirements and constraints in your&#xD;
        organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reuse the current elements that reflect your specific environment, such as templates and examples, by attaching&#xD;
        them to the newly proposed practice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify and prepare to collect the information or metrics that will tell you how well you're adopting this&#xD;
        practice. Make sure that the data for the metrics is easy to collect. Highly accurate metrics that are difficult to&#xD;
        collect are often abandoned, thus provide no value. Coarser measurements that are easy to collect usually provide&#xD;
        sufficient information, and it's more likely that they'll continue to be collected.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop an adoption plan with specific goals for each step. An iterative, incremental approach is recommended. Try&#xD;
        to tackle the problem points identified earlier.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Select a project to start applying the new practice. This pilot project should be visible and risky enough to&#xD;
        properly adopt this practice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Evaluate your adoption based on the objectives and metrics that you defined.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make adjustments based on your evaluation. Eliminate tools or tool features that don't prove effective, and&#xD;
        increase practices that are efficient and improve quality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the next step in adoption.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Continue to extend or modify this practice to reflect how your team and organization is performing this new process&#xD;
        and what the next increment of adoption should be for your team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol></mainDescription>
