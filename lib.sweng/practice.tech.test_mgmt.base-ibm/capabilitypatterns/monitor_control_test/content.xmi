    Special consideration should be given to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;strong>Capture the Changes in the Test Cycle&lt;/strong> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capture all of the changes agreed upon with the main development stakeholders in the iteration-related test plans.&#xD;
    Ensure that the test plans correctly reflect the iteration test planning. For example, keep the list of test cases&#xD;
    associated with a test plan up to date, as they implicitly define the scope covered by the plan. Make sure that all of&#xD;
    the test cases are prioritized in the context of the test plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Address the Level(s) and Type(s) of Testing&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on the agreed upon test process, create and maintain a number of test plans that should cover all of the testing&#xD;
    levels and types addressed by the current iteration. For example, you can have a one-to-one mapping between a test&#xD;
    level or a test type and a test plan within one iteration. Each test plan has to be assigned to a test team, so that in&#xD;
    the more complex case a test team will be responsible for multiple test plans. If the initial scope covered by one&#xD;
    specific test plan needs to be managed at a finer granularity level, create a new test plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Review Refined Test Plans with the Test Team&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each test team, identify the test plans that they are responsible for, and review their content. Pay special&#xD;
    attention to the items that add more risks to the current test cycle, and keep track of them during testing. Focus on&#xD;
    the scope of each test plan and agree on the priorities for the test cases included. Find a balance between the main&#xD;
    constraints: testing resources, time, and scope, by using the priorities and the risks as the main drivers.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Test Plan forms the framework within which the team performing the testing will work for the given schedule. It&#xD;
    directs, guides, and constrains the test effort, focusing the work on the useful and necessary deliverables. It also&#xD;
    communicates the intent of the effort to stakeholders. As such, the Test Plan should avoid detail that would not be&#xD;
    understood, or would be considered irrelevant by the stakeholders in the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cultures or domains in which this work product is not recognized as a formal work product, it is still important to&#xD;
    address the different aspects represented by the Test Plan as part of the planning effort, and make appropriate&#xD;
    decisions about what testing will be undertaken, and how the test effort will be conducted.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test motivator is usually an external file that provides details about a test plan or test case. For example, a test&#xD;
    motivator file could be a document or spreadsheet containing detailed information about a specific test plan or test&#xD;
    case. It is convenient to be able to reference a test motivator file from a test plan and test case record. Test&#xD;
    motivators are useful in linking test requirements with test plans and test cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div class=&quot;p&quot;>&#xD;
    You can use associations between test plan and test case records with a test motivator to determine: &#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            If there is test coverage for the motivator&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            If a test plan associated with a motivator has an associated external file&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div></refinedDescription>
