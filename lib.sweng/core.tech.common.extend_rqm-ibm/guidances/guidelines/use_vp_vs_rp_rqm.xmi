  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A manual test script contains steps, verification points and reporting points. The step is used to define an action to&#xD;
    be executed. The verification and reporting points are special steps where a comparison must be executed between what's&#xD;
    observed in the object under test and what is expected. In the case of manual testing the object under test can be an&#xD;
    application or a physical device (&quot;Is the light switched on?&quot;). There is no real difference on how RQM deals with a&#xD;
    verification point and a reporting point.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Adding more verification points to a script will give detailed reporting but will also be more time consuming (read&#xD;
    expensive) to execute. Use verification points and reporting points wisely. Make note that for every step or&#xD;
    verification or reporting point an associated defect could be created.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Special attention must be given to the last verification or reporting point. This sets the Actual Result in the&#xD;
    Execution Results of the test in RQM. The final state can be changed in the Execution Results before saving to a more&#xD;
    comprehensive state. The available states can be set in the administrative System Properties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Actual Result of the last execution is visible in the status of the test case. Reporting and queries make use of&#xD;
    this status in the Test Case Execution Result (TER).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By adding a final (reporting) verification point to each script, one can capture the overall assessment, complemented&#xD;
    with a comment from the tester, of the execution in the script log. The pass/fail result might be 'translated' into a&#xD;
    more comprehensive execution result for the test case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: The list for the Actual Result field can be customized by users with Admin privileges.&#xD;
