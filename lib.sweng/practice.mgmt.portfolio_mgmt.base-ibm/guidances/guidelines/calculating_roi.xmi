    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Return on investment (ROI) is a financial measure that compares the amount &#xD;
  of revenue or cost savings derived from an investment with the cost of that &#xD;
  investment. ROI is sometimes known as a &lt;em>profitability ratio&lt;/em>, because &#xD;
  it provides insight into the expected performance of an investment in using &#xD;
  the resources of the organization to generate income or other benefits. ROI &#xD;
  and other financial ratios can provide management with a valuable tool to measure &#xD;
  their progress against predetermined internal goals, a certain competitor, or &#xD;
  the overall industry.&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Simply speaking, when someone asks about ROI, they are really asking: &quot;What &#xD;
  do we get back (the return) for the money that we're being asked to spend (our &#xD;
  investment)? What is it really worth (ROI)?&quot; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Formula&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> The formula for calculating ROI for a single time period follows.&amp;nbsp;It &#xD;
  requires knowing the initial value of the investment (Vi), the final value of &#xD;
  the investment (Vf), and, from those two values, determining the yield (the &#xD;
  return) for that single time period.&amp;nbsp;The initial value in the formula might &#xD;
  simply be the cost of the investment; whereas, the final value of the investment &#xD;
  might be the payback or savings generated by that investment. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/roi_formula_1.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Thus, the return on investment equals the benefit (return) of the investment, &#xD;
  divided by the cost of that investment.&amp;nbsp;This formula is typically used &#xD;
  for short-term investments, such as those lasting less than a year. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The formula for calculating ROI for multiple time periods is shown here, too.&amp;nbsp;This &#xD;
  formula assumes that there are a number of time periods (n) and that the value &#xD;
  of the investment might change over that time period. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/roi_formula_2.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Example&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> In this example, we&amp;nbsp;look at the ROI for an IT investment for a three &#xD;
  year period, a typical period for IT projects.&amp;nbsp;The costs for hardware, &#xD;
  software, and labor are $400K per year, with $50K of license costs added for &#xD;
  Years 2 and 3.&amp;nbsp;There is a projected cost savings of $500K during the first &#xD;
  year, $600K in Year 2, and $750K in Year 3. &lt;/p>&#xD;

      &lt;td> &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;>&lt;strong>41.6%&lt;/strong> &lt;/div>&lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
  &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;p>&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>A more realistic example &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> In the real world, the more complex investments become as they grow, the more &#xD;
  complex the formula for calculating ROI becomes.&amp;nbsp;If you think about the &#xD;
  ROI for implementing a new system, for example, you must take into account changes &#xD;
  in productivity.&amp;nbsp;When a new system is put in place, there is an immediate &#xD;
  decrease in productivity as the users get used to the new system and new ways &#xD;
  of doing their work.&amp;nbsp;With time, productivity will climb back up to original &#xD;
  levels and should increase as the new system yields increased productivity and &#xD;
  other benefits. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Here is a standard formula for calculating first-year ROI.&amp;nbsp;It uses a &#xD;
  few key variables, such as system cost (A), monthly labor cost (B), training &#xD;
  time in months (C), productivity loss during training (D), and projected productivity &#xD;
  gain after training (E).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/roi_formula_3.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The numerator represents the value of the system implementation, which comes &#xD;
  from an increase in productivity.&amp;nbsp;The left bracket (B - (B / 1 + E)) is &#xD;
  the increase in average monthly productivity.&amp;nbsp;The right bracket (12 - C) &#xD;
  is the number of months in a year, minus the months spent in training.&amp;nbsp;For &#xD;
  example, if the user needs to spend two months in training to become productive &#xD;
  on the new system, then there would be 10 months remaining in the year to benefit &#xD;
  from the productivity gain. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The denominator represents the cost of the system implementation, which includes the cost of the system and the cost of&#xD;
    lost productivity (expressed in labor cost) as the users learn how to use the new system.&amp;nbsp;This cost of lost&#xD;
    productivity is the product of the monthly labor cost (B) multiplied by months in training (C) multiplied by&#xD;
    productivity lost during training (D).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    Let's substitute the following sample numbers into this equation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    A =&amp;nbsp;cost of hardware and software = $8,000&lt;br />&#xD;
    B = monthly labor cost = $3,700&lt;br />&#xD;
    C = training time of 2 months&lt;br />&#xD;
    D = productivity loss during training = 50%&lt;br />&#xD;
    E = productivity gain after training = 25%&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/roi_formula_4.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Using these figures, we would have a first-year ROI of approximately 63%, &#xD;
  which would be very attractive to decision-makers.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> How to use ROI analysis&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Organizations compare the rates of return of different investments to select &#xD;
  which investments to pursue to generate maximum return or wealth for the stockholders. &#xD;
  Organizations do so by considering the average rate of return, payback period, &#xD;
  &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkwithUsertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/npv_9E67A924.html&quot; guid=&quot;_jw8zgDNyEd6QsN5bdDcYQg&quot;>net &#xD;
  present value&lt;/a>, profitability index, and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkwithUsertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/irr_30B1CC83.html&quot; guid=&quot;_JYe3gEvHEd6Ona9n0Aj4EA&quot;>internal &#xD;
  rate of return&lt;/a> for various projects.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Keep in mind, however, that ROI analysis, in general, is a rather diverse &#xD;
  collection of methods, skills, tools, activities, and ideas that are useful &#xD;
  for assessing the relative value over time for an investment.&amp;nbsp;ROI methods &#xD;
  are not a single formula nor calculation that will yield a simple yes-no answer &#xD;
  to a question of how to invest.&amp;nbsp;The specific method that your organization &#xD;
  uses to calculate ROI will depend on the details of your situation and the data &#xD;
  that are available. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Strengths and weaknesses &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;strong>Strengths&lt;/strong>: ROI is a popular metric because of its simplicity &#xD;
  and versatility. ROI can help organizations in deciding whether they need to &#xD;
  pursue an investment, discontinue a program, or identify departments or other &#xD;
  assets that yield weak returns, so that they can gain an edge in the industry &#xD;
  or over a competitor. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;strong>Weaknesses&lt;/strong>: Although ROI tells you what percentage of return &#xD;
  you will get over a specified period of time, it does not tell you anything &#xD;
  about the magnitude of the investment. Thus, even though a 124% return might &#xD;
  seem attractive initially, would you rather have a 124% return on a $10,000 &#xD;
  investment or a 60% return on a $300,000 investment? That is why you will often &#xD;
  want to know the Net Present Value rather than the ROI.&amp;nbsp;Also, because ROI &#xD;
  is so simple, it is easy to manipulate for biased reasons and to express the &#xD;
  result in many different ways. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
