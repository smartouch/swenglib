  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When looking at the sum of all demands typically considered as part of a large portfolio, a variety of types and&#xD;
    characteristics can be identified within the numerous requests being considered.&amp;nbsp;Depending on its size, impact,&#xD;
    value, complexity, and numerous other factors and criteria, a given request can be subjected to more or less oversight&#xD;
    and controls, and it can require more or less formality and procedural support.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work pipeline construct allows dividing the overall demand funnel into subcategories. In this way, the supporting&#xD;
    process and procedures can be adapted to fit the needs and requirements of a particular category of requests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, at one end of the spectrum are requests for larger, longer-duration investments, such as new products or&#xD;
    strategic projects, which often require lengthy justifications, careful preplanning and rigorous governance oversight.&#xD;
    At the other end of the spectrum are much smaller, short-duration requests, such as Help Desk user requests, which&#xD;
    typically can be processed by using lighter forms and procedures, with minimal governance requirements.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When looking at the distribution of the sum of all requests coming into the portfolio, it is also common to find the&#xD;
    largest proportion of demands for the smaller requests category; the 80-20 rule-of-thumb is quite applicable to this&#xD;
    distribution.&amp;nbsp;The challenge lies in how to efficiently manage all of those requests and to apply the right amount&#xD;
    of process and controls, without grinding everything to a halt when peak demand loads are brought into the&#xD;
    portfolio.&amp;nbsp;The work pipeline construct provides the framework to group requests of similar types, adapt the&#xD;
    process to their specific needs, and extend the right amount of oversight and governance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on particular needs and requirements of different industries and market segments, the work pipeline&#xD;
    categories change to reflect grouping of characteristics or criteria of interest. But the basic framework and its&#xD;
    resulting benefits remain entirely applicable across the range of industries and market segments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    How the pipelines work&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 1 illustrates work pipelines.&amp;nbsp;As mentioned, work pipeline&amp;nbsp;is a notion of demand management, so it is&#xD;
    properly represented by using a funnel metaphor.&amp;nbsp;In this case, there are three examples of work pipelines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Infrastructure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        New features&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product families&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    &lt;img alt=&quot;Work Pipelines diagram&quot; src=&quot;./resources/work_pipelines.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the&amp;nbsp;graphic shows, work pipelines are a subdivision of the total demand being processed as part of the&#xD;
    portfolio. This requires that requests coming into the portfolio be properly defined and classified according to&#xD;
    predefined criteria&amp;nbsp;and metrics so that prioritization can be optimized within each work pipeline. The objective&#xD;
    is to maximize the overall value of the portfolio while minimizing portfolio risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    How to develop work pipelines&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following steps describe a high-level overview of the method to develop work pipelines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define the sources and types of work&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;The objectives of this step are to understand the&#xD;
        variety of requests, their specific characteristics, and their sources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop criteria based on work pipelines categories&lt;/strong>. This is done to&#xD;
        facilitate&amp;nbsp;classification of requests, to promote standardization, and to ensure that the request brought into&#xD;
        a particular work pipeline fits the category.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Prioritize and sequence requests to maximize portfolio alignment&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;One of the fundamental&#xD;
        objectives of&amp;nbsp;portfolio management is to ensure alignment between the activities undertaken within the&#xD;
        portfolio with the organization's strategic objectives and direction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop strategic resource consumption targets&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;This step is about controlling how much of&#xD;
        total capacity should be consumed by maintenance work vs. enhancements work vs. project work.&amp;nbsp;This approach&#xD;
        provides executives with the means to set explicit targets and monitor&amp;nbsp;how the day-to-day operations measure&#xD;
        against those targets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Release to capacity by work pipelines&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;This step is about monitoring that work released to&#xD;
        the operations and project teams relative to these teams' capacities to do the work. It is well-documented that&#xD;
        systematically overloading teams directly impacts their productivity. This approach provides the means to measure,&#xD;
        monitor, and adjust the amount of work released to the teams to promote productive and cohesive implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Monitor variances and balance portfolio&lt;/strong>.&amp;nbsp;After you have done all you can to ensure that work&#xD;
        authorized and released contributes to the strategic direction (by using standard criteria and measurements), the&#xD;
        remaining focus is to maintain the portfolio.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Benefits&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Aside from the adaptability advantage already illustrated, this framework also lowers the overall cost of managing the&#xD;
    sum of all user demands into the portfolio. This framework makes it possible to accelerate the treatment of small,&#xD;
    high-volume and low-impact requests, yet it ensures proper treatment of high-impact ones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This framework also provides the flexibility to adapt to particular needs of different market segments and industries.&#xD;
    The hardware development&amp;nbsp;industry will likely gravitate toward a construct of work pipelines as illustrated&#xD;
    previously; whereas,&amp;nbsp;software development industry will probably develop categories better suited to software&#xD;
    products and projects.&lt;br />&#xD;
