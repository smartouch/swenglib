  <mainDescription>&lt;p> The strategic goals of the firm influence the structures and the business &#xD;
  objectives of the portfolio, which in turn influence the portfolio constraints &#xD;
  and the metrics necessary to follow up on those constraints and business objectives. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The constraints can be grouped according to different dimensions, such as &#xD;
  resource consumption targets (for example: &amp;quot;At least 50% of the budget &#xD;
  should be spent on Research &amp;amp; Development projects with the goal of&amp;nbsp;generating &#xD;
  new products; 25% of the budget should be spent&amp;nbsp;on creating new versions &#xD;
  or&amp;nbsp;improvements&amp;nbsp;to existing products; and&amp;nbsp;the remaining 25% should &#xD;
  be spent on existing product maintenance&amp;quot;). Other constraints could relate &#xD;
  more to human resources. For example: &amp;quot;Only 25% of the development staff &#xD;
  can be assigned to field services work or other support-related activities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The product portfolio manager documents the&amp;nbsp;portfolio constraints and &#xD;
  related metrics&amp;nbsp;into a document that is distributed to the necessary stakeholders, &#xD;
  so that there is common understanding and consistent use of the information &#xD;
  across the organization. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To serve as a guide and reference to ensure that constraints and metrics are interpreted and used consistently throughout&#xD;
the organization and within the portfolio process.</purpose>
