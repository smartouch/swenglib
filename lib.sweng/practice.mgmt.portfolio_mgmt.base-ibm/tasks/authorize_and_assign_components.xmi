  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Provide sufficient control and governance over the process&amp;nbsp;that releases work to the operational teams. One key&#xD;
    notion to respect at this stage of&amp;nbsp;managing a portfolio&amp;nbsp;is to ensure that the total estimated work authorized&#xD;
    for release correlates with the organization's ability and capacity to execute that work.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> One portfolio target&amp;nbsp;frequently used to accomplish this task&amp;nbsp;is &#xD;
  the&amp;nbsp;strategic consumption target, which provides an indication of the proportion &#xD;
  of total capacity that the executives expect to see used for each work category. &#xD;
  The following is an example of strategic consumption targets: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        55% of capacity applied toward support work category&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> 25% of capacity applied toward enhancements to existing systems &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> 20% of capacity applied toward strategic projects (or products) &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> The benefits of an effective authorization and assignment of components are &#xD;
  two-fold: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>First, it guarantees an orderly release of work to the operational teams, thus &#xD;
  promoting efficient execution and increasing probability of meeting schedule &#xD;
  deadlines. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>Second, it promotes a recognition from the teams that management understands &#xD;
  the state of the business at the ground level and is prioritizing work accordingly. &#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Numerous studies and lessons-learned indicate that overloading resources with large work backlogs directly impacts&#xD;
    their productivity, which in turn negatively impacts timelines and production deadlines.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To provide&amp;nbsp;a control gateway for work that is authorized and released to the organization for execution.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
