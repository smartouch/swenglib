  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this stage of&amp;nbsp;defining and prioritizing components, compare each component within each work&#xD;
    pipeline&amp;nbsp;against one another to derive a sequential order of desirability, as defined by the portfolio metrics and&#xD;
    targets.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key concept&amp;nbsp;is the notion of a &lt;em>sequential order&lt;/em>. As the term implies, it is critical that the&#xD;
    prioritization process results in a list or queue of approved and ranked components (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/forced_ranking_136A0975.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_wzI6ACoHEd6g6fzzTTrDxQ&quot;>Forced Ranking&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp;Because the organization does not possess unlimited resources&#xD;
    and capacity, it is highly unlikely that all &quot;desirable&quot; components can be funded. Some components might show potential&#xD;
    contributions when evaluated on their own but would not be funded or authorized when considering constraints in&#xD;
    financial and human resource capacity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This prioritization process is also iterative, with loops cycling back to the selection of components task (when&#xD;
    establishing the initial priority for&amp;nbsp;components), as well as loops cycling back from the portfolio optimization&#xD;
    task (as part of balancing and authorizing the portfolio).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The analysis techniques used for this task are often common to those used for the selection of components, with the&#xD;
    difference that they now embed a representation of the maximum measure (portfolio target and metric) that reflects the&#xD;
    constraint under which the portfolio needs to be optimized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A corporate strategy definition&amp;nbsp;is used to&amp;nbsp;cover the situation when strategic changes in the company's&#xD;
    environment may impose sudden strategic changes in the portfolio, such as when the company has to prioritize a certain&#xD;
    platform project to quickly meet strategic moves by a competitor. Changes like these might overrule some of the&#xD;
    portfolio procedures in place that are designed for portfolio management in a normal business situation.&#xD;
