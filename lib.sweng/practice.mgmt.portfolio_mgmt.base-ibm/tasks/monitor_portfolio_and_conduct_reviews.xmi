  <mainDescription>&lt;p> Consolidate, analyze, and report current and predicted performance relative &#xD;
  to all dimensions of the portfolio, consistent with prescribed formats and standards, &#xD;
  measured against predefined targets, plans, and budgets, in support of the portfolio &#xD;
  decision framework. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The end-to-end portfolio monitor and control process is composed of a series &#xD;
  of supporting data review cycles, including daily team status and assignments,&amp;nbsp;weekly &#xD;
  project updates,&amp;nbsp;monthly product reviews, and&amp;nbsp;quarterly executive &#xD;
  reviews. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The collection and aggregation of data in support of those distinct but connected &#xD;
  cycles are ongoing processes that produce specific deliverables and reports &#xD;
  used at particular points in time of the overall portfolio review cycle. This &#xD;
  series of cascading reviews is carried out based on validated input about progress, &#xD;
  performance, risks, issues, capacities, and constraints, as well as&amp;nbsp;the &#xD;
  realization of expected benefits and changes to conditions under which all work &#xD;
  within the portfolios is being executed. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> During the various reviews, each component of the portfolio is assessed, measured, &#xD;
  and reported in relation to its expected contribution, as well as its relationships &#xD;
  and dependencies with other components and the portfolio as a whole. These review &#xD;
  cycles are typically included within the overall portfolio monitoring activities: &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Yearly or biannual business planning cycles &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quarterly executive and portfolio reviews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Monthly product and project reviews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Weekly project reviews and status meetings (phase or gate lifecycles)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Daily project team updates and assignments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> The main dimensions represented within the decision framework must be consistent &#xD;
  with those used to optimize the portfolios, such as these criteria: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Strategic objectives (for example: time to market and cost leadership)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Market conditions and situations (personas and user profiles)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Competitive situations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Financial targets and metrics (for example: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/roi_3DFEBD03.html&quot; guid=&quot;_bQTR0EvAEd6Ona9n0Aj4EA&quot;>return &#xD;
    on investment (ROI)&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/irr_30B1CC83.html&quot; guid=&quot;_JYe3gEvHEd6Ona9n0Aj4EA&quot;>internal &#xD;
    rate of return (IRR)&lt;/a>, return on assets, and payback) &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Capacity (headcounts and facilities)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical and architectural constraints and objectives&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk tolerance thresholds&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> Although these reviews occur at defined frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, &#xD;
  quarterly,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;yearly), the horizon of planning of the portfolio management &#xD;
  framework will span a period varying between 18 to 36 months and&amp;nbsp;up to &#xD;
  3 to 5 years, depending on the nature and culture of the organization. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The main outcome of this task is the production of validated and reliable &#xD;
  data and information for making portfolio decisions and selections. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> To consolidate measurements, performance, and trends collected during a &#xD;
    set of periodic reviews that involve all executive, management, and operational &#xD;
    teams&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> To escalate issues, risks, and changes of scope that require management &#xD;
    action and approval&lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
