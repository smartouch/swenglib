  <mainDescription>Safety and reliability are managed through the application of redundancy. Many different patterns exist to address safety&#xD;
and reliability concepts. This task clarifies the nature of the risks and puts into place measures (as defined by the&#xD;
relevant design patterns) that mitigate these risks.</mainDescription>
  <sections xmi:id="_Z4MIYNxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg" name="Analyze control measures" guid="_Z4MIYNxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg">
    <sectionDescription>This step analyzes the proposed solutions to ensure that they provide adequate risk mitigation and meet the other, possibly&#xD;
opposing, design constraints in an optimal way. This analysis is often done in the form of an FTA or FMEA.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>This step elaborates the architecture to include the safety and reliability design patterns, that is, implement the control&#xD;
measures at the architectural level.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_fcVGYNxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg" name="Select design solutions to add control measures to mitigate risks" guid="_fcVGYNxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg">
    <sectionDescription>Based on the nature of the risks and the other design constraints, different design patterns may be more optimal than&#xD;
others. This step selects one or more such patterns. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_jqyq4NxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg" name="Review the hazard analysis" guid="_jqyq4NxxEd-iT-dJmEtOOg">
    <sectionDescription>The hazard analysis is usually initially created during requirements definition (see Task: Manage Safety and Reliability&#xD;
Requirements). This document initially identifies hazards, risks, basic faults, and (possibly) control measure meant to&#xD;
mitigate the risks.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>The purpose of the safety and reliability architecture is to enable the system to identify, isolate, and correct errors&#xD;
during the system execution.</purpose>
