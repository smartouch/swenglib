    From the standpoint of this practice, analysis focuses on the essential and functional properties of a system while&#xD;
    design focuses on its optimization and deployment aspects. These design practices exist at three levels of concern.&#xD;
    Architectural design optimizes the system at a gross, overall level. Collaborative (also known as &quot;mechanistic&quot;) design&#xD;
    optimizes collaborations within the architectural. Detailed design optimizes individual classes, objects, functions,&#xD;
    data structures and types. At all levels, design proceeds primarily by identifying and ranking the optimization&#xD;
    criteria of concern, identifying design patterns and technical solutions that are consistent with the weighted set of&#xD;
    design criteria, applying the design patterns and technologies, and verifying the instantiated design solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Real-Time Architectural Design (RTAD) practice specifies how architectural design can be achieved through the&#xD;
    creation of (sub)models from different viewpoints. Five key viewpoints are identified, each of which has its own design&#xD;
    patterns and technical solutions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subsystem and component view&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Concurrency and resource view&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Distribution view&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Safety and reliability view&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment view&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition, there are a number of secondary architectural viewpoints - such as security, error and exception handling&#xD;
    policies, and dynamic quality of service management - that may be relevant to a particular system. It is important to&#xD;
    note that within a given microcycle or iteration, not all architectural viewpoints must be addressed, even though they&#xD;
    might be all addressed by the time the system development is complete.&#xD;
