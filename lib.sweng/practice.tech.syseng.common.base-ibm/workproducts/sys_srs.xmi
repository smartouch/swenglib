  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification is strictly the set of all relevant System Requirements for a project. This&#xD;
    set provides a complete and consistent abstract description of the solution to the problem represented by a stakeholder&#xD;
    specification or a similar artifact, and its context, at an appropriate level of abstraction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, there&amp;nbsp;may be several levels of&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification - for example, in some cases&#xD;
    the a single level might be enough, in others, the system must be broken-down into subsystems at various levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If more than one level of System Requirement Specification is used, then remember the following points:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each specification must be a complete and consistent description of the solution, at an appropriate level of&#xD;
        abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Traceability must be maintained throughout the levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All specifications must be maintained in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Frequently, it&amp;nbsp;is sufficient to evolve a single specification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The system requirements specification captures all of the system functional and non-functional requirements in one&#xD;
    place so that they may be analyzed for consistency, completeness and correctness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements must be clear, unambiguous, testable and complete. They must include all required properties of the&#xD;
    system. Care must be taken not to over-specify (a common problem) by including design measures in the requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this artifact is to capture, in one place,&amp;nbsp;the technical requirements of the system to be built.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>The system requirements specification drives development and is the basis for verifying that the system will meet the&#xD;
stakeholder requirements.&amp;nbsp; Without this artifact it will&amp;nbsp;very difficult&amp;nbsp;to verify that the system&amp;nbsp;will&#xD;
satisfy&amp;nbsp;the stakeholder requirements.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>The system requirements specification may be represented as a document created in a&amp;nbsp;word processing tool, as a report&#xD;
from a database or as a report from a commercial requirements management tool.</representationOptions>
