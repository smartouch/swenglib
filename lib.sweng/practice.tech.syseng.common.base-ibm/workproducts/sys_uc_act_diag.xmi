  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Activity Diagram is similar to the classic flow chart. It describes a workflow, business process, or algorithm by&#xD;
    decomposing the flow of execution into a set of actions and sub activities joined by transitions and various&#xD;
    connectors. These actions and sub activities are called activity nodes. An activity can be a simple linear sequence of&#xD;
    activity nodes or it can be a complex series of parallel activity nodes with conditional branching and concurrency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will be multiple instances of this artifact.&amp;nbsp;During requirements analysis, &quot;black-box&quot; activity diagrams are&#xD;
    created describing the functional flows for the system as a whole.&amp;nbsp;During architectural design,&#xD;
    &quot;white-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;activity diagrams are created that show the allocation of actions to specific system elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities may be grouped and assigned to objects - e.g. subsystems. In this case, the activity diagram is split into&#xD;
    swim lanes that depict the respective responsibilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>To describe the functional flow for the system to validate and refine of the system requirements and to&#xD;
support&amp;nbsp;architectural analysis&amp;nbsp;and design.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact it will be difficult to specify the required behavior of the system with the level of detail,&#xD;
completeness and clarity required to validate the development team's understanding of the required behavior and to&#xD;
communicate effectively.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>This artifact is a UML/SysML artifact. There will be many activity diagrams that describe the system from different&#xD;
perspectives and with different levels of detail. They may be represented as reports or views from modeling tools or as&#xD;
diagrams in a document.&amp;nbsp;The former provides additional confidence&amp;nbsp;in the consistency of the information and is&#xD;
highly recommended.</representationOptions>
