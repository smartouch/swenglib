  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact records information about relationships between information in the development. It is often a logical&#xD;
    rather than a physical construct. There is generally no specific physical &quot;place&quot; where all this information exists,&#xD;
    but it is distributed throughout the physical storage of the information used for development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The traceability record&amp;nbsp;allows those involved in the development of a system to understand the relationships&#xD;
    between different elements in the development, for example, which requirements are tested by a particular test case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where information is needed about the relationships between two specific types of information (for example Stakeholder&#xD;
    Requirements and System Requirements), it is often extracted into a Traceability Matrix.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>This artifact allows those involved in the development of a system to understand the relationships between different&#xD;
elements in the development, for example, which requirements are tested by a particular test case.</purpose>
