  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Statechart Diagram describes the state-based behavior of a block. It is one of&amp;nbsp;the most important behavior&#xD;
    diagrams because&amp;nbsp;it aggregates the information from both the activity diagram (functional flow) and the sequence&#xD;
    diagrams (interactions with the environment), and adds the event-driven block behavior to the diagram. As the&#xD;
    &quot;language&quot; of statecharts is formally defined, the correctness and completeness of the resulting behavior can be&#xD;
    verified/validated through model execution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statechart diagrams are finite state machines that are extended by the notation of &lt;strong>&lt;em>Hierarchy&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    and &lt;strong>&lt;em>Concurrency&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Basically, a statechart diagram is comprised of a set of states joined by transitions and various connectors. An event&#xD;
    may trigger a transition from one state to another. Actions can be performed on transitions and on state entry/exit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most of the cases a&amp;nbsp;System Block Statechart Diagram&amp;nbsp;is defined for each leaf system block.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    emergent behavior that results from the collaboration of each leaf block statechart diagram&amp;nbsp;must reflect the&#xD;
    functional flow captured in the white-box activity diagram&amp;nbsp;as well as the associated&amp;nbsp;white-box sequence&#xD;
    diagrams.&#xD;

  <purpose>The purpose of this&amp;nbsp;artifact is to capture a formal representation of&amp;nbsp;a system&amp;nbsp;block behavior to provide the&#xD;
means to verify and validate the system architecture model through model execution.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact it would not be possible to validate the system architectural model via model execution.</impactOfNotHaving>
