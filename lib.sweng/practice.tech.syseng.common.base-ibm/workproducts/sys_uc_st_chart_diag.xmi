  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Statechart Diagram describes the state-based behavior of a block. It aggregates the information from both the&#xD;
    activity diagram (functional flow) and the sequence diagrams (interactions with the environment), and adds the&#xD;
    event-driven block behavior to the diagram. As the &quot;language&quot; of statecharts is formally defined, the correctness and&#xD;
    completeness of the resulting behavior can be verified/validated through model execution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statechart diagrams are finite state machines that are extended by the notation of Hierarchy and Concurrency.&#xD;
    Basically, a statechart diagram is comprised of a set of states joined by transitions and various connectors. An event&#xD;
    may trigger a transition from one state to another. Actions can be performed on transitions and on state entry/exit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Use-Case&amp;nbsp;Block Statechart Diagram must reflect the functional flow captured in the use-case black-box activity&#xD;
    diagram as well as the associated use-case black-box sequence diagrams.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To capture a formal representation of the use-case block behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To provide the means to verify and validate a use-case through model execution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>If the use case behavior is not captured through the Black-Box Statechart Diagram, it is not possible to verify/validate&#xD;
the completeness and correctness of the functional system requirements that are allocated to the use case.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>This diagram is usually represented as a UML/SysML state machine&amp;nbsp;diagram.</representationOptions>
