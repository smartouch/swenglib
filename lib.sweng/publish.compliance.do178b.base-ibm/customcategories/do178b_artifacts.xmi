  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The DO-178B standard calls out the need for a number of different work products. Some of these work products are the&#xD;
    normal outcome of the execution of the Rational Best Practices. Some of the work products will need to be created from&#xD;
    data that is the normal outcome of the Rational Best Practices, but are not necessarily formulated as stand-alone work&#xD;
    products. Other work products are not normally produced during the execution of the Rational Best Practices but are&#xD;
    added to address the specific needs of this standard.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This page provides links to the definition and description of these work products. Many of them will include additional&#xD;
    guidance such as checklists, term and concept definitions, examples, and templates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that the DO-178B standard calls for a number of project plans as deliverables. It is anticipated that the process&#xD;
    content in this website forms the base content for most of those plans (see the Artifact section). This entails&#xD;
    customizing this web site for each new project with project-specific information. This refers specifically to the&#xD;
    Software Configuration Management Plan, Software Quality Assurance Plan, Software Development Plan, and Software&#xD;
    Verification Plan, supplemented with additional project data in external documents. The Plan for Software Aspects of&#xD;
    Certification is created within the DO-178B Certification Practice but results in an external document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The various standards documents (requirements standard, coding standard, etc) are provided in the form of checklists&#xD;
    within the practices.&lt;br />&#xD;
