    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> This metric establishes the link between the operational and strategic layers &#xD;
  of the organization by using the Portfolio Management model.&amp;nbsp;An important &#xD;
  dimension of the portfolio management value proposition is&amp;nbsp;to provide&amp;nbsp;a &#xD;
  framework to manage and trace management accountability across the product portfolio &#xD;
  decision process. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> The linkage between the operational and strategic layers of the organization &#xD;
  can take several shapes, depending on several internal and external factors. &#xD;
  There are some drivers that can&amp;nbsp;influence the specific portfolio governance &#xD;
  metrics&amp;nbsp;that need to be part of&amp;nbsp;the portfolio management process: &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Management organizational structures and responsibilities &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Capabilities of the supporting systems &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li>Level of management oversight imposed by industry regulations and compliance &#xD;
    requirements &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Measurement method &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Total number of portfolio governance controls that apply to each type of (proposed &#xD;
  or ongoing) work.&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Measurement analysis &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> This metric is typically represented across the entire lifecycle of the portfolio &#xD;
  management model, both as part of the initial review and assessment of new work &#xD;
  being considered for inclusion in the portfolio as well as during the ongoing &#xD;
  monitoring and controlling activities. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Examples&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Some metrics, such as &quot;funding approval,&quot; focus on tracking that specific &#xD;
  steps or tasks are diligently conducted as part of the reviews and approvals &#xD;
  of work. This typically serves to demonstrate that no exceptions to the approval &#xD;
  process are allowed. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Other metrics, such a &quot;proportion of projects released without a budget baseline,&quot; &#xD;
  are designed to reflect the general quality of the information used for management &#xD;
  decisions. In such cases, the metric is used to capture the current state of &#xD;
  business,&amp;nbsp;which helps executives set targets for improvement and measure &#xD;
  the progression toward those targets.&lt;br />&#xD;
