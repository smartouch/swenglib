    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metric is particular to project&amp;nbsp;and product work pipelines and is about re-enforcing that proper business&#xD;
    justification needs to be presented and considered as part of the organization's portfolio investments decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> A frequent but not necessarily&amp;nbsp;best practice approach within organizations &#xD;
  is to initiate projects or products that are perceived as critical -- for purposes &#xD;
  of urgency or expediency -- without ensuring that&amp;nbsp;the requirements of the &#xD;
  portfolio review and investment process will be met.&amp;nbsp;The unfortunate reality &#xD;
  is that this frequently represents back-door entry to fund executive pet projects &#xD;
  and bypass the need to develop and present the justification to other members &#xD;
  of the executive team. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Aside from closing the back door to the firm's funding process, this metric &#xD;
  emphasizes that providing proper business justification is a pivotal step to &#xD;
  optimizing the use of funds to maximize the overall portfolio value. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Measurement method &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Total number of proposals compared to total number of&amp;nbsp;business justifications. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Measurement analysis &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p> Depending on the technology in place to manage the portfolio investment process, &#xD;
  some of this monitoring can be achieved in a semiautomatic manner through data &#xD;
  extracts and trending, or it can be done manually through project peer reviews &#xD;
  or project phase gate review audits. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Examples &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li> A&amp;nbsp;count of proposals with proper justification divided by the total &#xD;
    amount of proposals: &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;blockquote> &#xD;
    &lt;p>&lt;em>Example: &lt;/em>65% of proposals approved included the required business &#xD;
      justification&lt;/p>&#xD;
  &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
  &lt;li> A&amp;nbsp;dollar-value (or local currency) variant of that measure and expressed &#xD;
    as a percentage of total investments in the project or product work pipeline: &#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
      &lt;p> &lt;em>Example: &lt;/em>45% of total dollars invested in the strategic project &#xD;
        work pipeline included the proper business justification &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
