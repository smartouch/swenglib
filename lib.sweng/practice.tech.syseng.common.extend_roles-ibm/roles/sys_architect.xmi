  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role defines a system architecture that will satisfy the system requirements and meet the project objectives to&#xD;
    minimize cost and risk.&amp;nbsp; The role analyzes possible solution architectures to determine&amp;nbsp;the preferred&#xD;
    high-level design for the system.&amp;nbsp; Models of the architecture are created to verify that&amp;nbsp;the design will meet&#xD;
    the requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;focus is on&amp;nbsp;establishing and refinement of the system's structural aspects&amp;nbsp;and is concerned with the&#xD;
    optimization of these structures in terms of major system elements and their interfaces, and making trade-offs in&#xD;
    competing factors and constraints (for example, performance, cost, environmental impact), in evaluating potential&#xD;
    solutions that produce the required behavior.&amp;nbsp;Its view spans the entire system and all factors, external and&#xD;
    internal, that might affect its development. Given the need to maintain this broad view, this role&amp;nbsp;rarely engages&#xD;
    in depth in the detailed engineering of a system, preferring to leave that to other practitioners in the various&#xD;
    engineering specialties.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A person performing this role needs:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical competence and strong communication skills (both written and verbal)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sound knowledge systems architecture and design methodologies&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Critical reasoning skills and decision making skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Creativity in figuring out solutions to complex problems&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Skill in expressing him or herself in the language in which the architecture is captured (e.g. UML)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Leadership qualities, in order to drive the technical effort across the various teams, make critical decisions&#xD;
        under pressure and make those decisions stick&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>If the project is large enough to warrant a system architecture team, the goal is to have a good mix of talents, covering a&#xD;
wide spectrum of experience and sharing a common understanding of the systems engineering process. Ideally in such a team&#xD;
there is an individual, almost certainly the lead, who owns the overall vision for the project.&amp;nbsp;The system&#xD;
architecture team should not be a committee of representatives from various teams, domains, or contractors. System&#xD;
architecture is a full-time function, with staff permanently dedicated to it.</assignmentApproaches>
