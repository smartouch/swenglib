  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Practice measures provide control metrics enabling managers and individual team members to evaluate and understand the&#xD;
    impact of changes in IT towards improving operational effectiveness. Typically, these will focus on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effectiveness of individual behavior and team collaboration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality of work products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rate of change adoption related to an initiative&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maturity of individuals and teams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measures dealing with the monitoring, analyzing, and reporting of adoption and maturity are subjective measures while&#xD;
    measures of the quality of work produced are objective. Practice measures provide interim snapshots for how the&#xD;
    individuals and teams are progressing towards meeting the operational and related business objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Practices are narrowly focused processes for individuals and teams. Practices are applied in IT in support of a change&#xD;
    initiative for improving operational effectiveness. For each defined operational objective, identify one or more&#xD;
    practices needing improvement or adoption, to improve&amp;nbsp;operational effectiveness.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe how each practice supports the achievement of one or more operational objectives. Document this information in&#xD;
    the artifact, Measurement Requirements.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The amount of change associated with practices must be understood in light of the impact to individuals and teams. The&#xD;
    amount of change is not constant, meaning not all companies or all groups within them accept changes at the same rate.&#xD;
    Implement the changes in small increments. To do that, they must be prioritized. The prioritization of practices and&#xD;
    their measures must be synchronized with the operational objectives and their related business objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The role performing this task, working with IT management prioritizes these practices and documents this prioritized&#xD;
    list in the artifact, Measurement Requirements.&#xD;

        A roadmap that will identify timing and content of each increment for fully implementing a multi-tiered measurement&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Name&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Manner of collection&#xD;

  <purpose>Practice measures provide the ability to monitor individual and team behaviors for effectiveness. This is the lowest level&#xD;
of granularity enabling the management team to monitor results over a shorter period of time. Establishing measures at the&#xD;
control level of a multi-tiered Performance Measurement System enables management to make tactical adjustments towards the&#xD;
achievement of the operational and related business objectives.</purpose>
