  <mainDescription>IT managers are responsible for ensuring the assets within their organization are able to maximize performance to&#xD;
customers. Businesses undergo change at varying rates and degrees but they do change. Technology changes, people come and&#xD;
go, products and services change to meet customer expectations. Working with a Solution Architect, managers in IT need to&#xD;
be aware of how they are impacted by these changes as well as how they can change their organization to improve business&#xD;
performance. A multi-tiered Performance Measurement System should be an integral element of decision making by IT managers.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business objectives are goals to achieve to enhance business performance. They are not the same as a vision statement&#xD;
    for a company. Vision statements speak of the culture of a company and are abstract in nature. Business objectives are&#xD;
    explicit statements that can be quantified and typically have dollar values associated with them. State each business&#xD;
    objective so that it clearly and concisely articulates the achieved business value from meeting the objective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, the business objectives relate to one or more of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operation costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Return on investment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Poorly defined business objectives or objectives not tied to business performance result in wasted effort and cannot be&#xD;
    evaluated as to whether the goal was ever met. Once the business goals are identified, prioritize them. Prioritization&#xD;
    may be based on the amount of ROI, a backlog of business enhancements, or customer satisfaction but the decision is&#xD;
    focused on what is best for the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A prioritized list of business objectives is used to implement changes in an incremental or phased approach.&#xD;

    After identifying and describing the business objectives in a measurable form, identify the measures for each. A&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business objectives are achieved through the performance of the company. For IT the performance is related to the&#xD;
    people, processes, and tools within IT. An operational objective identifies a focus of effort to align IT&#xD;
    performance&amp;nbsp;with the achievement of a business objective. Operational objectives, and their associated measures,&#xD;
    are typically described for concepts such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Productivity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time to market&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consistency&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For an organization that has defined operational objectives, assess them and evaluate their relevance to the identified&#xD;
    business objectives as well as their relationship to the identified business objectives. Are the operational&#xD;
    objectives:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Abstract&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Too broad of scope&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quantifiable&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actionable&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessing existing operational objectives may very well show that they need to be reworked. Whether they are usable as&#xD;
    is, need reworked, or are entirely new will bring management focus to bear on the people, processes, and tools to&#xD;
    achieve them and their related business objective. This focus means some amount of change in measuring of individual&#xD;
    and team behavior to understand the effectiveness of operations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define a small set of operational objectives that relate to one or more of the business objectives. It is recommended&#xD;
    that fewer operational objectives be identified in order to focus resources and cost on less broad-based initiatives.&#xD;
    Using a more surgical approach provides a better chance for successful change. Operational objectives typically result&#xD;
    in more change of individual and team behavior. It is through the behavioral effectiveness of individuals and teams&#xD;
    that business objectives are met.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the operational objectives are identified and the relationships to business objectives established identify a&#xD;
    small set of measures of efficiency for monitoring and analysis to reason about progress towards achievement of the&#xD;
    operational and business objectives. Determine the frequency for the metric collection and analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As with business measures an operational objective that cannot be measured cannot be met. For each measure:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify how the measure relates to a business measure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Describe the measure in clear text&#xD;
