    &lt;strong>Overview of Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM)&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the most challenging tasks in developing and maintaining software or systems is to meet critical project cost,&#xD;
    schedule, and technical objectives. With more complex capabilities in today's software applications, products, and&#xD;
    systems, effective management of development and maintenance efforts is a key factor in project success. Practical&#xD;
    Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) was developed to help managers meet these challenges through measurement. It&#xD;
    describes an information-driven measurement process that will address the unique technical and business goals of your&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    PSM is currently available as a stand-alone plug-in for IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Method Composer Version 7.5. In addition, the&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational Unified Process&amp;reg; (RUP&amp;reg;) plug-in for Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) integrates the&#xD;
    measurement activities, artifacts, and concepts described by PSM, thus replacing the measurement concepts provided by&#xD;
    the RUP base framework. By deploying this plug-in, your organization and projects will have more extensive measurement&#xD;
    guidance to help you track progress in project costs, schedules, and technical objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    More information on the PSM plug-ins&amp;nbsp;is available&amp;nbsp;on &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/downloads/08/rup_psmv3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>IBM developerWorks&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Relationship Between PSM and the Performance Measurement Practice&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The guidance in PSM represents the best practices used by measurement professionals within complex software and system&#xD;
    acquisition and engineering communities. Although PSM can support many types of projects - large and small - PSM's&#xD;
    measurement practices have largely been used and applied on large government, DoD (Department of Defense), and&#xD;
    commercial software and systems projects and programs. Therefore, its primary focus is on larger, more formal software&#xD;
    and systems engineering project and program efforts where conformance with formal standards and methodologies is&#xD;
    required, as this diagram illustrates:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Performance Measurement practice provides guidance based on multi-tiered measurement that categorizes measurements&#xD;
    based on business, operational, and practice objectives. This does not mean that the performance measurement system is&#xD;
    incompatible with PSM; rather, it is complementary and provides a different way of looking at the key objectives of&#xD;
    measurement. Where the PSM primarily focuses on project- and program-level measurement, the performance measurement&#xD;
    system includes business- and operational-level measurements. In addition, the performance measurement system includes&#xD;
    concepts and measures that can easily be applied with agile development management techniques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Usage Guidance&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both the PSM and performance measurement system can be applied on many different project types and sizes, from small to&#xD;
    large projects, as well as large, complex software and systems. As general guidance, IT organizations that are new to&#xD;
    measurement might want to start with the performance measurement system. Small agile projects, as well as projects&#xD;
    applying agile development techniques, should also consider starting with the performance measurement system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Large complex software and systems engineering projects that require a more formal and rigorous measurement process as&#xD;
    well as organizations who have already established PSM, should consider the &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/downloads/08/rmc_v7.5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Practical Software and Systems&#xD;
    Measurement family of plug-ins&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for Rational Method Composer. In addition, organizations that need to align&#xD;
    closely with ISO/IEC 15939, the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), as well as other standards based on&#xD;
    ISO/IEC 15939 (e.g., ISO 12207, 15288, and others) may also want to start with the PSM plug-in. The PSM plug-in has&#xD;
    been extended for the Rational Unified Process, or RUP.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Again, this guidance does not mean that you should use either one or the other. In fact, content from both could be&#xD;
    applied by an organization that uses IBM Rational Method Composer.&#xD;
