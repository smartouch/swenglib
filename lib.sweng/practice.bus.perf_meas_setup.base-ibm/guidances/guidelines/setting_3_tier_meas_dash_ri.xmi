  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A three-tier measurement system involves multiple dashboards that show business-, operational-, and practice-level&#xD;
    data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Business-level dashboards&lt;/strong> or scorecards present high-level trend information only, no details. The&#xD;
    purpose is usually to let the users know if there is anything that they need to handle. That way, they won't spend time&#xD;
    looking into situations that do not currently need their attention. IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight contains several Executive&#xD;
    dashboards that present this information. You can modify them to suit specific needs. Generally, these dashboards&#xD;
    should include measures that illustrate progress (or lack of progress) against the organization's business objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Operational dashboards&lt;/strong> address organizational performance and effectiveness. They generally are&#xD;
    related to the business-level dashboards and present operational measures that have been identified as supporting the&#xD;
    organization's operational objectives. For example, a business-level cost indicator might be followed by an operational&#xD;
    productivity dashboard, or a business-level customer satisfaction indicator might be followed by an operational quality&#xD;
    dashboard.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Practice-level dashboards&lt;/strong> supply information intended to help an organization improve its&#xD;
    effectiveness and to measure progress during an improvement process. These dashboards should contain practice-oriented&#xD;
    metrics that are related to the practices that the organization has adopted to meet business and operational goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to follow the procedure outlined in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/creating_dashboard_ri_ED15203A.html&quot; guid=&quot;_pBdXcBKPEd6XR8gtzfa27w&quot;>Creating a Dashboard using Rational Insight&lt;/a> for each of the three tiers. The Value&#xD;
    Traceability Tree (VTT) provides a framework for doing this, because relationships between the tiers are essential. The&#xD;
    VTT can help relate business objectives shown in business-level dashboards to operational objectives shown in&#xD;
    operational dashboards. The VTT also recommends practices that can be used and measured to achieve the desired&#xD;
    improvements in the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data for all of these is available from IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight, although it may need to be customized for specific&#xD;
    environments. Reports to present that data can be constructed with Cognos Report Studio and inserted into dashboards as&#xD;
    described in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/creating_dashboard_ri_ED15203A.html&quot; guid=&quot;_pBdXcBKPEd6XR8gtzfa27w&quot;>Creating a Dashboard using Rational Insight&lt;/a>. IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight includes an&#xD;
    extensive set of sample reports that may meet your needs or that you can customize.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight also contains examples of dashboards. One convenient way to structure these dashboards is as a&#xD;
    &lt;em>multipage&lt;/em> dashboard. This method provides a pane on the left side with the names of several dashboards, and&#xD;
    users can display the ones that they want with a single click. The names come from a Cognos folder hierarchy, so there&#xD;
    is no hardcoded list or programming. See the Executive View dashboard provided for an example, and see Cognos&#xD;
    documentation for details on how to implement that dashboard.&#xD;
