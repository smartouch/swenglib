    Most organizations have stated goals the business or an IT organization is to work toward. Invariably, the words are&#xD;
    ambiguous and difficult to directly trace with quantifiable outcomes. These goals must be decomposed into sub-goals&#xD;
    using quantifiable terms which in turn, are measurable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In any IT organization it is a long way from individual and team behavior and contributions to a business goal. Almost&#xD;
    everyone will state that doing such and such should improve what ever business goal is being addressed. But the&#xD;
    question is not one of intuition or even logic but one of proof. How does one prove that changing certain aspects of&#xD;
    individual or team behavior directly affects one or more stated business goals? The answer lies in the ability to&#xD;
    decompose goals into sub-goals until measurable data is reflected in the sub-goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a business might chose to emphasize the improvement of customer satisfaction. Let's assume that customers&#xD;
    of a product maintained by an IT department are very dissatisfied with the quality that product and the satisfaction&#xD;
    rating coming from the customers has been dropping over a period of years. There is much to uncover to understand all&#xD;
    of the variances contributing to low customer satisfaction. For a performance measurement example, we will assume that&#xD;
    what needs to be uncovered has been or will be uncovered, but our effort is just to define the measures for monitoring&#xD;
    progress towards that improvement with the subsequent tasks of creating and configuring the actual infrastructure to&#xD;
    implement the measures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the beginning, the goal might look something like, &quot;Improve customer satisfaction.&quot; To keep from wasting a lot of&#xD;
    time, this stated goal needs more clarification in order to establish measures unique to this IT department and their&#xD;
    customers. Two useful techniques in refining goals and setting proper context of understanding are to use S.M.A.R.T.&#xD;
    (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) attributes with the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The S.M.A.R.T. technique is to define the goal with S.M.A.R.T. attributes. GQM focuses on goal questioning to drive&#xD;
    towards data elements that are measurable. Using both approaches aids in decomposition of an ambiguous goal into&#xD;
    sub-goals for which metrics can be identified. Using both techniques together may result in changing the focus of the&#xD;
    original goal due to better understanding of what is needed by the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Goal Setting with S.M.A.R.T. and GQM&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Specific&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A goal needs to be specific. The goal of, &quot;Improve customer satisfaction&quot; appears to be specific from the perspective&#xD;
    of what to focus on. But there could be any number of methods used to improve customer satisfaction. Which ones are the&#xD;
    right ones? Once the right ones are implemented, how is the implementation of the necessary changes progressing?&#xD;
    Questions like the following help add clarity around the goal:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will we be sure the satisfaction has actually improved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why is it necessary to improve customer satisfaction?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improving customer satisfaction results in what?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is causing low ratings of customer satisfaction?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How much improvement is needed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Answers to these kinds of questions help develop the appropriate context to assist an organization with the specificity&#xD;
    of the goal. The answers should result in the one goal becoming multiple goals, or sub-goals, focused on the following&#xD;
    associated elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve customer satisfaction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increase revenue from product ABC&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve product quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is no stretch of the imagination to go from improved product quality to improved customer satisfaction and then for&#xD;
    a business to increased revenue for the product. In an attempt to be more specific about a goal this organization now&#xD;
    has three goals that are interrelated. But it is still a little bit of a &quot;leap of faith&quot; to get to the &quot;right&quot; set of&#xD;
    measures for monitoring the effectiveness of the change effort that is expected to bring about the improvement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Measurable&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To know that a goal has been or will be achieved, it must be measurable. While a specific goal might be to increase the&#xD;
    customer satisfaction index, to know that it has been accomplished there must be one or more data elements (attributes)&#xD;
    to measure in order to reason about the success of achieving the goal. In order to understand what those attributes are&#xD;
    or where to look for them, the following questions are the types of questions to ask:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How much improvement is needed in customer satisfaction to be considered successful?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How much revenue increase is necessary in order to demonstrate that what ever changes occur at individual and team&#xD;
        levels define the criteria of success for those changes?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How long is reasonable to reason whether the goal is being met?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What data elements are needed to build the measure(s) around?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Restating the previously stated interrelated goals as measurable sub-goals may result in something like the following&#xD;
    where x and y in each statement are expressed in quantifiable terms (i.e., attributes than can be measured):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve the customer satisfaction index from 75 to 90, a 20% improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increase the amount of revenue from product ABC from $1.25 million to $5 million.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Our example is rather straight forward and it may actually take several attempts to get to a sub-goal level that&#xD;
    identifies attributes that are directly measurable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Achievable&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This S.M.A.R.T. goal characteristic must be addressed and cannot be ignored. It is not enough to &quot;want&quot; to achieve a&#xD;
    specific goal; it must actually be within the realm of possibility. The goal may actually be considered a stretch, but&#xD;
    still achievable. Ignoring this characteristic sets people up for failure. In our example, the organization considered&#xD;
    the amount of changes and effort necessary to improve quality for product ABC. The organization has determined that a&#xD;
    more realistic approach for them that would allow them to achieve the end result would be to establish achievable goals&#xD;
    for a three year period with a much more realistic upper percentage of improvement set at 5%. This means that the&#xD;
    organization is acceptable of a customer satisfaction index of 79 for product ABC. While that may be considered low, to&#xD;
    this organization it is acceptable, especially since they plan on removing product ABC from the market sometime over&#xD;
    the next 8-10 years. They will still be able to generate an acceptable revenue stream while R&amp;amp;D is creating a much&#xD;
    more robust replacement. Restating the sub-goals for the customer satisfaction index means they might look something&#xD;
    like the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve customer satisfaction for year 1 from 75 to 76 resulting in a 1% improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve customer satisfaction for year 2 from 76 to 77.5 resulting in an overall 3% improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve customer satisfaction for year 3 from 77.5 to 79.1 resulting in an overall 5% improvement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maintain a customer satisfaction index of 79 or higher each year until product ABC is removed from the market.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do not forget that once the business goal is achieved, it must be maintained. In order to maintain it, it must be&#xD;
    monitored to prove that it is being maintained.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Relevant&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This characteristic focuses on the relevancy of the goal. The specified sub-goal must be relevant to the broader&#xD;
    context of the goal. Using an example from above, a goal that would not be relevant might look like, &quot;Improve team&#xD;
    efficiency by 5%.&quot; While that might be a worthwhile endeavor, in this organization it is not relevant to improving&#xD;
    customer satisfaction. The dissatisfaction is based on product quality and focusing on team efficiency may actually&#xD;
    prove detrimental to improving customer satisfaction. Address the most critical need, and then focus on the other needs&#xD;
    of the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Time-bound&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Regardless of the many typical management mandates issued in most organizations, change takes time. It is not as easy&#xD;
    as reading a book or taking a class to make the transition complete. In IT organizations, change in behavior is deep&#xD;
    seated and will result in varying levels of resistance. You are attempting to move people from their sphere of comfort&#xD;
    into an unknown environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, the time given to a change initiative must take into account the effect of change and managing the necessary&#xD;
    changes to bring about the successful accomplishment of the goals. However, there must be a time limit established. The&#xD;
    amount of time given to the effort must be commensurate with the amount and effect of the change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this example, customer satisfaction index is calculated once every year in February. And the current month is&#xD;
    October. There are only 3 months to get the changes instituted and the product fielded with a sufficient number of&#xD;
    current and future customers to have an adequate amount of time to react to the improved product. Being real means it&#xD;
    won't happen. That means the organization has 15 months to get to the first derived measure, a score of 76 for customer&#xD;
    satisfaction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Measures&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using S.M.A.R.T. attributes and the GQM technique allows organizations to develop measurable sub-goals and identify the&#xD;
    data needed for the measures used to monitor progress towards the sub-goals. From that, any necessary calculations&#xD;
    needing performed along with how this will be reported to management, are defined and all are unique to an&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once business goals are identified at the appropriate level for measuring, operational groups within IT decompose these&#xD;
    measurable goals into a set of goals for their own group using S.M.A.R.T. and GQM approaches. These operational goals&#xD;
    are at a lower abstraction level than the business goal they trace to and are specific to the organizational&#xD;
    contributions necessary to meet the business goal. The operational groups then identify the measures to be used for&#xD;
    monitoring progress towards the achievement of their own goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the operational goals and measures are identified, processes are identified along with objective and subjective&#xD;
    measures for monitoring them. At the individual and team level, one or more development practices are identified with&#xD;
    associated measures for monitoring progress. These are explicitly traced to the appropriate operational goals. This&#xD;
    completes the explicit tracing between business goals, operational goals, and practices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using S.M.A.R.T. and GQM techniques at each level of a multi-tiered performance measurement system provides the&#xD;
    framework of proof to senior management that changes at individual and team levels explicitly impact a specific&#xD;
    business goal.&#xD;
