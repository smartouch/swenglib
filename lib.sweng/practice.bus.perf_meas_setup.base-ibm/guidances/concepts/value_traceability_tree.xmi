  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Value traceability trees are used to understand what strategies and associated measurements may be appropriate to&#xD;
    address target business drivers, as well as what changes to delivery strategies will be required for each strategy to&#xD;
    succeed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Value traceability trees do this by providing models that link each operational objective (such as Reduce Time to&#xD;
    Delivery, Improve Quality, Increase Value, and Improve Predictability) to a set of strategies with associated selection&#xD;
    criteria that addresses each objective. Symptoms and indicators enable you to understand whether the root causes that&#xD;
    each strategy addresses may be present. Each strategy maps to a set of solutions that outline a set of control&#xD;
    measurements, delivery practices, products, and services that help you succeed with the strategy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As in the figure below, a value traceability tree can be used to&amp;nbsp;identify the relationship of&#xD;
    business&amp;nbsp;objectives to operational objectives. However, in this guideline, we do not address any specific business&#xD;
    objectives. Typically, the business objectives depend on the organization's line of business. For example,&amp;nbsp;one of&#xD;
    the business values of&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;insurance business unit is the claim volume that cannot apply to other lines of&#xD;
    business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img height=&quot;458&quot; alt=&quot;Value Traceability Tree&quot; src=&quot;resources/vtt.gif&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is no obvious set of practices or strategies that can improve each operational objective. Some strategies may be&#xD;
    able to improve more than one objective. For example, reducing the number of defects can improve the quality of the&#xD;
    product and, at the same time, fewer defects means less effort to re-work, which reduces the development lifecycle.&#xD;
    Next figure shows the impact of the improvement strategies on other&amp;nbsp;operational objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
