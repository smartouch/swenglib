    The main measures are introduced within a multi-tiered Performance Measurement System.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Multi-tiered Performance Measurement System&quot; src=&quot;resources/mcif_context.jpg&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Business Measures&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although business measures vary according to business context and objectives, all corporations, especially publicly&#xD;
    traded companies, share a common view of business performance. Here, the primary focus is the growth of the company and&#xD;
    the ability to meet the expectations of shareholders, management, and customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most common means of capturing business performance is in the form of financial balance sheets and income&#xD;
    statements, which, as a standard practice, provide information about the current viability of the business itself.&#xD;
    Generally, financial measures are preferable (indeed, they are often required), because business stakeholders commonly&#xD;
    view business performance according to financial results, and monetized measures are more easily evaluated and&#xD;
    compared. The range of criteria to evaluate includes these financial measures:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Profit&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operating costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Return on capital or assets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, business managers often augment the financial view with additional measures that address fundamental business&#xD;
    priorities. These are frequently expressed as key performance indicators (KPIs) that result from strategic initiatives,&#xD;
    such as these examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Market share or penetration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product or service volume, inventory, backlog, or other measures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Client turnover&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customer satisfaction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Industry analyst market assessments.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Operational Effectiveness&amp;nbsp;Measures&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although business measures are primarily focused externally for evaluation of the company's performance in the market&#xD;
    environment, operational effectiveness measures are internally focused, concentrating on operations within the company&#xD;
    and their ability to perform the most critical functions to meet business obligations. Managers often seek operational&#xD;
    performance measures that provide the most effective means of predicting business outcomes. That is, they look for&#xD;
    leading operational indicators of company performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given the wide variation of organizational functions and contexts, operational effectiveness measures are less&#xD;
    standardized. However, the most common operational objectives target these criteria:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Productivity or efficiency&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Throughput or time to market&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality achievement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Predictability and consistency&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perceived value and satisfaction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Still, it is critical to establish a clear understanding of the operational context to ensure that the associated&#xD;
    measures are incentives for behavior that leads to the desired outcomes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Practice-Based Control Measures&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When an organization seeks to improve its operational effectiveness, management defines specific targets for&#xD;
    operational improvement. However, the means of achieving such improvements requires that the organization adopt new&#xD;
    ways of performing the key functions and associated tasks. Generally classified as &lt;em>practices&lt;/em>, such innovative&#xD;
    solutions include combinations of technologies, methods, techniques, and resources. Managers must then be able to&#xD;
    assess the organization'&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s effectiveness in adopting these new practices through the introduction of control measures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the term suggests, &lt;em>control measures&lt;/em> establish quantitative indicators with associated thresholds of&#xD;
    attainment to provide an objective means of determining the degree organizational capability. With proper&#xD;
    practice-based control measures to quantify the organization's behavioral maturity, managers can then adjust adoption&#xD;
    methods, thereby ensuring effective and timely practice adoption. Examples include these measurements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect density and repair rate&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test coverage and execution&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Velocity, iteration burn down&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Build stability, Build frequency.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As with operational effectiveness measures, practice-based control measures are context sensitive. Indeed, measures at&#xD;
    this level must be calibrated to both key organizational and environmental factors, as well as the current level of&#xD;
    organizational maturity with the practices targeted for adoption. That is, the measures must simultaneously exhibit the&#xD;
    following characteristics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Alignment with achievement of the targeted behaviors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Thresholds that are attainable by a significant majority of the organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measurements that are precise enough to detect incremental improvements or deviations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
