  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM&amp;reg; Rational&amp;reg; Insight&amp;nbsp;includes an Executive Quality dashboard &quot;Out of the Box&quot; (OOTB) that displays information&#xD;
    for these metrics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect density&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect backlog&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect repair latency&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enhancement request backlog&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first&amp;nbsp;three are further broken down by pre-shipment and post-shipment. This indicates how many defects are not&#xD;
    detected before the product is released.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Together, these charts give you a good overview of how effectively your organization manages quality assurance (QA).&#xD;
    They support such indications as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increasing defect density may indicate problems with code development, QA procedures, or inadequate testing,&#xD;
        especially if the trend of the defects goes up before shipment and the trend continues after shipment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Not managing the defect a backlog could cause customer dissatisfaction and reduce the quality of the shipped&#xD;
        product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Long turnaround time for fixing defects can also contribute to a perceived quality problem.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Timely delivery of new requirements keeps the product useful to your customers. It improves your customer&#xD;
        responsiveness image, yields a more competitive product, and can increase customer satisfaction. However, it can&#xD;
        also cause churn problems that delay product shipment, so you must evaluate the tradeoffs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The sections that follow describe each of the four charts a bit more and show examples.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Defect Density&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defect Density is defined by defects per thousand lines of code and broken down according to severity. Generally, you&#xD;
    would expect the defect density to increase with project size. However, it should start to decrease over time,&#xD;
    especially for higher severity. The trends shown in the following chart should raise concerns, because density is not&#xD;
    decreasing much.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;505&quot; alt=&quot;Defect density&quot; src=&quot;./resources/vttqualitydashboard1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Defect backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The defect backlog is how many open defects are in the system, broken down by severity. This chart is similar to the&#xD;
    previous one, except that project size is not included. The curves should show the same trend though, with a decreasing&#xD;
    slope later in the project. The following chart does show this, and the late-December peak in critical defects should&#xD;
    be looked into further.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;505&quot; alt=&quot;Defect backlog&quot; src=&quot;./resources/vttqualitydashboard2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Defect repair latency&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defect repair latency is the turnaround time between when a defect is submitted to when it is resolved, broken down by&#xD;
    severity. Put another way, defect repair latency is the amount of time required to resolve reported defects. The upward&#xD;
    slopes in the following chart might indicate a problem, because the time required to resolve critical defects is&#xD;
    increasing.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;460&quot; alt=&quot;Defect repair latency&quot; src=&quot;./resources/vttqualitydashboard3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Enhancement request backlog&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The enhancement request backlog, according to priority (low, medium, high), indicates how the project team is meeting&#xD;
    requirements. Generally, the number of open requirements should decrease over time, as they are implemented. The&#xD;
    following chart shows that requirements (including high-priority ones) are increasing. This implies that more&#xD;
    requirements are being added to the project. It would be essential in this situation to look into why so many new&#xD;
    requirements are being introduced, how to control that situation, and how to effectively deal with them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
