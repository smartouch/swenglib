    The Performance Measurement practices help you to set up and operate a performance measurement system to help you&#xD;
    understand whether your organization is performing as desired, and guide you in what actions to take to improve your&#xD;
    performance:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this release we are providing an initial approach to measurements, reports and improvement actions for the business&#xD;
    improvement dimension Reduce Cost, one of five main dimensions that we have found relevant for almost all organizations&#xD;
    that we have worked with.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The approach to measured improvement is based upon a multi-level model of business objectives, operational objectives&#xD;
    and (execution) control measure which is supported by a network or association to support reasoning about capabilities&#xD;
    and their impact. This network and combined model is called a Value Traceability Tree (VTT) - see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/value_traceability_tree_5D64B55D.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CkI9oONsEd6BSpdo_oJF_A&quot;>Concept: Value Traceability Tree&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IBM offers a sample VTT based on experience. This VTT can speed up the selection of new capabilities,&#xD;
    including&amp;nbsp;metrics to use during deployment to monitor outcomes and tune adoption. These new capabilities are&#xD;
    deployed using process guidance (the Practices, Tool Mentors, Tool Guidance, Artifacts, Reports and dashboards provided&#xD;
    here) and tools (IBM Rational products like Rational Team Concert, DOORS and Rhapsody). The VTTs supplied can be&#xD;
    extended and focused for other specific dimensions, such as compliance or audit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this initial VTT for Systems Engineering improvement we focus on Reduce Cost, and specifically the reduction of&#xD;
    engineering cost, a contributor to system lifecycle cost - see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.syseng.common.extend_vtt-ibm/customcategories/op_obj_reduce_cost_792AD9FF.html&quot; guid=&quot;_80F5ALSmEeCCVtbEo2kNjw&quot;>Operational Objective: Reduce Cost&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Practices for Performance Measurement we provide suggestions for this primary dimension, of Reduce Cost, for the&#xD;
    measures to leverage to understand whether an improvement project meets your target objectives, including reports to&#xD;
    consider. You find that further drill down leads to descriptions of metrics, and that many metrics have guidance on how&#xD;
    to interpret them and what corrective actions to take based on what they are showing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These same project level metrics and reports can be used to measure performance across a set of projects. Value&#xD;
    Traceability Trees (VTTs) guide you in what systemic improvement actions to take. The VTT for each dimension,&#xD;
    articulates strategies and solutions that can provide a systemic improvement in performance, symptoms to look for to&#xD;
    determine which strategies and solutions to apply, and the practices, and metrics and tools that help you effectively&#xD;
    implement target solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you are making changes to how you work, you want to make sure those changes lead to better results. These&#xD;
    Performance Measurement practices (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_setup.base-ibm/guidances/practices/setting_up_perfm_measumt_systm_39398229.html&quot; guid=&quot;_BCk0sN5nEd2J7couKHLTuw&quot;>Setting up a Performance Measurement System&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.bus.perf_meas_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/practices/managing_perfm_measurement_D73D6729.html&quot; guid=&quot;_9pzIwN5rEd2J7couKHLTuw&quot;>Managing Performance through Measurements&lt;/a>) guide you in how to effectively set up&#xD;
    and leverage multi-tier measurement system to both understand whether you get the desired outcome (through outcome&#xD;
    measures), and whether the improvement actions you are taking are effectively implemented (through control measures).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Additional improvement Strategies, Solutions and Metrics are available from the base IBM Performance Management System.&#xD;
