    Engineering costs can be measured in budgetary expense or hours of effort and additional costs to sustain the human&#xD;
    effort, apply IT and instrumentation to system development and supporting, often external, service and capital costs.&#xD;
    Companies typically seek to reduce engineering cost either as an objective in its own right, such as to drive down&#xD;
    expense to revenue, or as a way to free up resources to drive growth or innovation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Engineering cost are typically made up of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Direct and indirect cost of people (fully burdened)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Internal overhead and service charges like IT and corporate services e.g. facilities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        External service provider costs - design house, contractors, training, legal, escrow services&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        External capital costs - IT, technical equipment, tooling&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Within the VTT and consideration of Strategies and Solutions the primary cost contributors for systems delivery are :&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce Engineering cost of direct Systems Engineering and Requirements Engineering effort&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce Engineering cost of rework across all disciplines&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce the engineering cost of quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce third party expense e.g. engineering contractor cost&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases it is possible to reduce or avoid contract penalties that may result from missed or unfulfilled&#xD;
    requirements&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore in looking for impact on these cost contributors the Practices, and their supporting tools, provide a means&#xD;
    to eliminate or reduce work and unproductive effort hence drive cost. Work being here the useful expenditure of effort.&#xD;
    In addition we aim to propose reports, indicators and dashboards that assist the monitoring of effort and its products,&#xD;
    via Practice control measures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The VTT and Practices for Systems Engineering does not directly include the Project Management and Project Accounting&#xD;
    practices for measuring cost. Certain of these are available in the base IBM Rational Practices and IBM Cognos Industry&#xD;
    Blueprints which can be applied with Rational Insight.&#xD;
