    Not all stakeholders are created equal. It is crucial for the development team to understand who the stakeholders are&#xD;
    that will leverage the solution. If pertinent stakeholders and their needs are not captured, the requirements process&#xD;
    and end solution&amp;nbsp;can be significantly hampered. The following techniques aid in identifying stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Directed interviews&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An analyst must capture the major business process activities and whom or what executes them. What are their key needs&#xD;
    in the system, what problems exist for this role today and why? What would a successful solution provide to this role?&#xD;
    Success Tip: Questions&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;drive a specific outcome or information about who, what, and&amp;nbsp;when;&#xD;
    questions&amp;nbsp;must not be open ended.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Fishbone Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A directed technique to understand who is having a problem, and why they are having the problem. Success Tip: Use a&#xD;
    fishbone diagram to get to the heart of the business problem and whom is having the business problem. Each branch on&#xD;
    the bone depicts a problem or an issue that contributes to the business problem,&amp;nbsp;and whom is having it. Keep&#xD;
    asking questions until a better understanding is reached of whom the stakeholders are and what are their problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Customer Survey&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pertinent stakeholders are identified in a textual form and business problems. Success Tip: Use a customer survey to&#xD;
    quickly document whom the stakeholders are and their key issues. Often the customer survey is simply to provide a high&#xD;
    level list of problems and stakeholders. More in depth techniques&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;leverage this information.&lt;br />&#xD;
