  <mainDescription>Concurrence represents an agreement from the stakeholder regarding requirement assets that are reviewed. In the case of the&#xD;
Vision document these requirement artifacts would include the business problems and proposed solutions to those problems.&#xD;
Obtaining agreement is crucial as it ensures the stakeholder and development team are on the same page. Concurrence can be&#xD;
achieved through a number of techniques. The key point to note is that the ideal is to involve the stakeholder early and&#xD;
often. The development organization&amp;nbsp;must provide updates to the customer at regular intervals where functional code&#xD;
may be demonstrated which resolves a specific need. Concurrence from the stakeholder must be obtained to ensure the team is&#xD;
on track.</mainDescription>
