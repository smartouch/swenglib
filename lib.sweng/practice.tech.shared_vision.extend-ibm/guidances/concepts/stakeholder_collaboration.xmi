  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continual collaboration with key stakeholders is imperative across the software development lifecycle. The Vision is no&#xD;
    different. The Vision document provides a foundation for software development activities. This foundation is gained by&#xD;
    understanding the stakeholders in the business process; identifying their needs, and understanding the business problem&#xD;
    to be solved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Vision document defines the problems and goals known at the time when it was initially written. The goals of the&#xD;
    stakeholder can evolve as the development team begins defining the solution. The development team can in fact find&#xD;
    different and perhaps better ways to address the business problem. As a result, it is critical for the development team&#xD;
    to be lockstep with the stakeholders as the solution is developed. Collaboration is key. Collaboration&amp;nbsp;can be&#xD;
    obtained in many ways: reviews, documented discussions, etc. Many considerations regarding the importance of&#xD;
    collaboration and understanding stakeholder's goals are important for organizations that adopt Outside In thinking.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
