&lt;p>&#xD;
    The term &quot;integration&quot; refers to a software development activity in which separate software components are combined&#xD;
    into a whole. Integration is done at several levels and stages of the implementation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Integrating the work of a team working in the same implementation subsystem before releasing the subsystem to&#xD;
        system integrators.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Integrating subsystems into a complete system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recommended approach&amp;nbsp;to integration is to &lt;b>incrementally&lt;/b> integrate the software. Incremental integration&#xD;
    means that code is written and tested in small pieces, and then combined into a working whole by adding one piece at a&#xD;
    time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The contrasting approach to incremental integration is &lt;b>phased integration&lt;/b>. Phased integration relies on&#xD;
    integrating multiple (new and changed) components at a time. The major drawback of phased integration is that it&#xD;
    introduces multiple variables and makes it harder to locate errors. This is primarily due to the fact that an error&#xD;
    could be in any one of the new components, in the interaction between the new components at the core of the system, or&#xD;
    in the interaction between the new components.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_integration__benefits_of&quot; name=&quot;XE_integration__benefits_of&quot;>&lt;/a>The benefits of incremental integration are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Faults are easy to locate.&lt;/b> When a new problem occurs during incremental integration, the new or changed&#xD;
        component, or its interaction with the previously integrated components, are the obvious places to look for a&#xD;
        fault. Incremental integration also makes it more likely that defects are discovered one-at-a-time, which makes it&#xD;
        easier to identify faults.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>The components are tested more fully.&lt;/b> Components are integrated as they are developed and then tested. This&#xD;
        means that the components are exercised more often than if integration is done in one step.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Something is running earlier.&lt;/b> Developers see early results from their work instead of waiting for everything&#xD;
        until the end, which is better for their morale. It also makes getting early feedback possible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
