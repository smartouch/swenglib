    Testing host applications&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing host applications, also known as terminal-based applications or green-screen applications, presents sufficient&#xD;
    distinct challenges to be a specialty in its own right. In many cases, neither the individual tester nor the test&#xD;
    tool&amp;nbsp;suite has system administrator authority, and it is often desirable for testing to have minimal impact on the&#xD;
    host systems. Non-host-based test tools must coordinate&amp;nbsp;their interactions with the host system, waiting&#xD;
    until&amp;nbsp;the host system is ready for input or finished producing output. And while workstation applications are&#xD;
    often characterized by the creation and destruction of&amp;nbsp;objects throughout the execution of the application, host&#xD;
    applications typically do not create and destroy distinct objects, but their progress is reflected in the&amp;nbsp;changing&#xD;
    of the text displayed on the screen.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Automating the testing of host applications&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Rational Functional Tester Extension for Terminal-based Applications (FTE) leverages the power of Rational Functional&#xD;
    Tester (RFT) to terminal-based host applications: MVS and VM (TN3270), OS/400 (TN5250) and Unix (VT terminal types).&#xD;
    RFT provides a powerful&amp;nbsp;platform for testing Windows-based Java and web applications, producing test scripts in&#xD;
    Java (in the Eclipse environment) or Visual Basic (in the Visual Studio .NET environment). FTE extends this power to&#xD;
    terminal-based host applications. FTE installs on Windows workstations; nothing needs to be installed on the host&#xD;
    system.&amp;nbsp;FTE uses HOD's Host Access Class Library (HACL) to communicate with the host system, and RFT to drive&#xD;
    testing and produce test scripts.&amp;nbsp;For more information about FTE, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_fte-ibm/guidances/toolmentors/fte_aaa_getting_started_6934D0C3.html&quot; guid=&quot;_IMVWQHjwEdyhRNciHt44hg&quot;>Tool Mentor: Getting Started with Rational Functional Tester Extension for Terminal-based Applications (FTE)&lt;/a> .&#xD;
