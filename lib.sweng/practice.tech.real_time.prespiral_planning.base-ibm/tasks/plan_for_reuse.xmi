  <sections xmi:id="_R_SbUKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Identify reuse needs" guid="_R_SbUKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>In this step, the business needs for reuse must be elucidated. This might include the need to build a product line from a&#xD;
common repository of reusable units, to identify a set of reusable components for use in different products, etc. Reuse&#xD;
might be at different levels of artifacts, including specifications, templates, models, design patterns, individual&#xD;
classes, source code, test suites, test fixtures (e.g. simulators), etc.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_Taem8KDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Identify reuse opportunities" guid="_Taem8KDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>This step identifies both opportunities to reuse existing work products in the current project and to use the current&#xD;
project as a platform to create reusable work products for which there is a business need.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_U0yBwKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Estimate cost for constructing reusable assets" guid="_U0yBwKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>There is significant anecdotal evidence that the creation of reusable work products is on the order of three times the cost&#xD;
of special purpose work products. This step identifies the projected cost and effort required for the reusable assets to be&#xD;
constructed.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_Ww5wMKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Determine which reusable assets to construct" guid="_Ww5wMKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>This step scopes the project work that concerns the creation of reusable assets. The number and scope of the reusable work&#xD;
products are constrained by the available money and resources within the project.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_Yu9_YKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Evaluate impact of reuse plan on schedule" guid="_Yu9_YKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>Reusable elements cost more in both development and testing than special purpose work products. This step evaluates the&#xD;
impact of the set of reusable artifacts on the project schedule.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_anqmYKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Specify how reusable assets will be managed" guid="_anqmYKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>To effectively reuse assets, stakeholders must be able to identify and find the assets and understand the problem context&#xD;
properties required for the reuse of the assets, the needs the assets address and the costs of using the assets.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_csb6gKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Specify how assets will be reused" guid="_csb6gKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>For new reusable assets, the problem context requirements for the asset, the cost and benefits of the asset, and the means&#xD;
by which the asset is intended to be reused must be clarified.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_eZ9zUKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Capture the reuse planning aspects" guid="_eZ9zUKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>Identify the reusable assets, how they will be stored, managed, and reused.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_hTVNIKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q" name="Update schedule to reflect reuse" guid="_hTVNIKDmEeC3BtbOsE9k9Q">
    <sectionDescription>Once the scope and other properties of project reuse is established, the schedule must be updated to reflect the impact of&#xD;
the reuse plan.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to clarify the needs and plans for creating reusable assets and plans for how those assets will&#xD;
be reused within this and possibly future projects.</purpose>
