    <sectionDescription>Projects that treat workers as interchangeable are far less efficient than ones that take advantage of workersâ€™ individual&#xD;
strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Not every one has the skill to solve partial differential equations, construct an&#xD;

ability.</sectionDescription>
