  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical architecture is the set of organizing principles and structures for the development project. The largest&#xD;
    single aspect of this is the organization of the system model(s). The goals of a good logical architecture are to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        allow team members to complete their work as efficiently as possible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        minimize interactions between teams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        maximize access to the parts of the model they need but don't have control of&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        maximize ease of sharing parts when needed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        minimize rework and independent recreation of the same elements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        maximize the ease of system construction (compilation and deployment on target platforms)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How large is the project?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How many development teams are involved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How large is each team?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are the teams colocated?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will the teams collaborate and share model artifacts?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the degree of interaction among the models or portions of the models?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there architectural design patterns, guidelines, or principles to be shared across models?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Will the team be receiving a handoff model from system engineering?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there legacy components, libraries, or source files to be shared among the teams?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is the hardware platform available to all team members for integration?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will integration occur, who will do it, and when and where will this take place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>One of the model structure attempts to optimize is the collaboration within and between teams. The best model structures&#xD;
take into account the set and structure of the teams that will work on the models. The teams need to be clarified as to&#xD;
their responsibility (e.g. work on a subsystem, define requirements, manage assets between teams, etc.).</sectionDescription>
