  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Party Phase looks at several aspects of the project to determine what, if any, corrective actions are necessary to&#xD;
    optimize a project's performance. This is done at the end of each spiral to improve the project progress on subsequent&#xD;
    ones. Normally, the increment review is performed in 1/2 to 1 day of calendar time and includes only project lead&#xD;
    personnel (project manager, architect, safety czar, quality assurance, and team leads).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many projects have a &quot;post mortem&quot;. This comes from the medical parlance that means to discover the cause of death.&#xD;
    Since the Harmony Process is a &quot;the cup is half full, not half empty&quot; in its perspective, this periodic analysis is&#xD;
    viewed as a &quot;celebration of ongoing success&quot; hence &quot;Party&quot; not &quot;post mortem.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Increment Review occurs at the end of every micro-cycle and may take anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of&#xD;
    days to perform, depending on the scope of the problem and how well the project is progressing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Increment Review focuses on the following aspects of the prototype being developed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Schedule - Is the project on schedule? If not, can it be put back on schedule? Possible solutions include feature&#xD;
        reductions, outsourcing, project reorganization, resource reallocation, and rescheduling.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architecture - The architecture is normally elaborated in different aspects as the project progresses. It is&#xD;
        important that the final architecture is being approached in a converging fashion. Because architectural defects&#xD;
        are so expensive, their identification and correction as early as possible is crucial to project success.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process - Is the process working well? Are there process steps that are too expensive, time-consuming, or difficult&#xD;
        to perform? This aspect focuses on fixing any defects or problems in the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk - Most projects that fail do so because risks were ignored. In the Harmony process, a Risk Management Plan is&#xD;
        an important artifact. In this activity, the risks in the plan are examined to be sure that they are being&#xD;
        appropriately handled in a timely way as well as looking for new risks looming on the horizon.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
  <sections xmi:id="_TbAl8J3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA" name="Review team issue questionnaire" guid="_TbAl8J3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA">
    <sectionDescription>While optional, it is recommended to solicit feedback from your team members as to what roadblocks they have encountered&#xD;
during their work. This feedback can be more-or-less formal. Less formal is recommend. The issues identified by the team&#xD;
members are reviewed during this step to identify corrective actions or alternative workflows that address the concerns.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_VwBVgJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA" name="Review schedule" guid="_VwBVgJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA">
    <sectionDescription>The schedule is reviewed to identify any lagging or leading tasks in execution of the planned schedule, develop alternative&#xD;
strategies if required, and to update the planned schedule as necessary. Such activities might include rearranging the&#xD;
worker assignments, moving out or in a scheduled task, adding new staff, adding support tasks (such as training), and so&#xD;
on.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_WqSlYJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA" name="Review architecture" guid="_WqSlYJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA">
    <sectionDescription>The architecture develops over a number of microcycles. The increment review ensures that the architecture is meeting the&#xD;
current needs and is scaling to meet the anticipated future needs. If a problem is identified, a task to develop a more&#xD;
robust scalable architecture may result.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_Xi6PcJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA" name="Review risks" guid="_Xi6PcJ3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA">
    <sectionDescription>During the Increment Review, the risk reduction activities performed during the previous microcycle are examined and their&#xD;
results evaluated and used for the basis of adapting the development plans and schedules. In addition, future risk&#xD;
reduction activities are examined to ensure they are still applicable. Lastly, newly identified risks are evaluated to see&#xD;
if they should be added to the Risk Management Plan and result in risk reduction activities.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_YZTE4J3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA" name="Review process workflows" guid="_YZTE4J3GEeC0Asc9EUyvKA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    During initial planning, detailed workflows are often constructed to provide guidance for tasks such as&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        configuration management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        requirements management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        requirements traceability&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        system build and compilation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        unit testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Due to technical, infrastructure, or personnel reasons, these workflows sometimes prove to be problematic or&#xD;
    inefficient. You don't have to live with an inefficient workflow. During this review, you examine problematic workflows&#xD;
    to optimize them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, it may happen that you've chosen to centralize your configuration management onto a remote server but the&#xD;
    connection to that server is down half of the time. Rather than live with this, you might make a local backup on the&#xD;
    server onto a local server and use it instead for the day, reconciling the two servers overnight.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of the Increment Review (&quot;Party Phase&quot;) is to measure progress against plan and to adjust to optimize progress&#xD;
and minimize the effect of any slippage.</purpose>
