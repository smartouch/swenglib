  <mainDescription>This work product outlines the characteristics of the product being developed and of the development project relevant to&#xD;
certification. This plan will provide an overview of system and software architecture and the proposed safety criticality&#xD;
level(s) for the product (with justification). This plan may refer to other plans, such as the SQAP, SDP, or SVP, as and&#xD;
when appropriate.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take care to not be overly prescriptive in this plan, since the development organization will be held to whatever this&#xD;
    plan specifies or it will raise too many questions early in the product development lifecycle. In general, the PSAC&#xD;
    should be 40 pages or fewer in length. Nevertheless, the scope of the system responsibilities, expected technologies,&#xD;
    methods, and architectures should be clearly identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The PSAC is normally reviewed early in the project by the regulatory agency or a Designated Engineering Representative&#xD;
    (DER).&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The purpose of this work product is to provide a clear description of the relevant aspects of the product and project for&#xD;
certification purposes to both the regulatory agency and development organization.</purpose>
