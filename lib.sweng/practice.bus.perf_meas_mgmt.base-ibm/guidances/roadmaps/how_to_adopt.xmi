    Getting Started&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice assumes that you have set up a performance measurement system&amp;nbsp;in your&amp;nbsp;organization. You have&#xD;
    specified measurements based on the organization's business&amp;nbsp;and operational objectives and&amp;nbsp;developed&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;measurement infrastructure to collect and report on the measurement data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this practice, begin by deploying the performance measurement system to the organization. Create a deployment plan&#xD;
    that identifies the tasks and responsible resources for all stages of the deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify a set of pilot projects so that you can validate the measurements and the infrastructure and make needed&#xD;
    improvements before deploying to the entire organization. Provide mentors to accelerate adoption and to collect lessons&#xD;
    learned.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the tasks that are required to manage the performance measurement system in order to get the most effective&#xD;
    and efficient use from it. Monitor measurement data as it is collected from projects. Perform analysis at the project&#xD;
    and organizational levels in order to monitor results against the defined business and operational objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evaluate the performance of the system (the measurement infrastructure and the process of collecting, reporting, and&#xD;
    analyzing measurement data) regularly. Identify any changes to the organizational objectives and priorities and adjust&#xD;
    the performance measurement system accordingly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common Pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The effectiveness of a deployed performance system increases with its use; nonetheless, many attempts at sustaining&#xD;
        a measurement system have failed due to the lack of use and commitment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is crucial to seek feedback, rather than simply expecting it to come to you. Unfortunately, it is human nature&#xD;
        to dislike change. Therefore, those who are responsible for the&amp;nbsp;performance&amp;nbsp;measurement system need to&#xD;
        evaluate the relevance and value of all input before modifying the system. Decisions for modifying any portion of&#xD;
        the measurement system should be based on whether or not the organizational and business objectives are being met&#xD;
        or not.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The impacts of changing individual and team behavior to achieve business and organizational objectives probably&#xD;
        will not be apparent for a much longer time than it takes for the effects on individuals and teams to become&#xD;
        apparent. Because of this, it is important that everyone implementing and using the measurement system understand&#xD;
        this. The success of a measurement system should never be determined in anything less than eight months to a year.&#xD;
        It takes time for changes at the lowest level of an organization to show sustained benefit at the organization and&#xD;
        business levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Periodic assessments of the performance measurement system&amp;nbsp;should occur to support continuous&#xD;
        improvement.&amp;nbsp;It also&amp;nbsp;sends a clear statement from management that the measurement system is important.&#xD;
        This will prevent it from becoming forgotten and useless.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
