  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To efficiently use a performance measurement system, you must manage it daily.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although you will gather metrics, not all metrics identified in a measurement plan will be available nor useful at the&#xD;
    beginning of the deployment. For example, in the context of a project lifecycle, code- and testing-related metrics will&#xD;
    not be available yet. As you begin to collect these metrics, they are most useful to those who are working on the&#xD;
    project. Metrics related to practice adoption and artifacts provide the first look at the effects of any change driven&#xD;
    by the IT organization. Operational- and business-related metrics are aggregations, typically, so they are more useful&#xD;
    as more collection points are included.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analyze measurement data at the project and organizational levels according to documented analysis procedures for each&#xD;
    metric.&amp;nbsp;Monitor results against defined operational objectives&amp;nbsp;in order to assess the results of capability&#xD;
    improvements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that reports are run on the appropriate timings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also, mentoring will be required as new individuals begin to use the performance measurement system. This mentoring&#xD;
    will address specific issues with the current tasks that individuals are performing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Validation of the impact of the measurement system can occur only with constructive feedback. As the measurement system&#xD;
    is deployed to a broader user base, those responsible for maintaining the whole system for an IT organization become&#xD;
    more removed from the day-to-day use by the various personnel and teams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is crucial to seek feedback, rather than simply expecting it to come to you. Unfortunately, it is human nature to&#xD;
    dislike change. Therefore, those who are responsible for the IT measurement system need to evaluate the relevance and&#xD;
    value of the input before modifying the system. Decisions for modifying any portion of the measurement system should be&#xD;
    based on whether or not the organizational and business objectives are being met or not. Although everyone that&#xD;
    provides feedback should be thanked, personal likes and dislikes are of less importance than the needs of the&#xD;
    organization and business.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you begin to collect measurement data, establish and maintain baselines of the organization's process performance to&#xD;
    support analysis efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Variance in performance of the&amp;nbsp;organization's processes&amp;nbsp;due to project tailoring should be taken into&#xD;
    consideration as baselines are&amp;nbsp;created.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Categorize baseline subgroups&amp;nbsp;according to&amp;nbsp;tailoring&#xD;
    factors and criteria&amp;nbsp;such as project size and complexity. Confirm baseline approach with stakeholders and revise&#xD;
    as needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
