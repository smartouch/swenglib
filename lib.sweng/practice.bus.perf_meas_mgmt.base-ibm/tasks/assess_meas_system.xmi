    The impacts of changing individual and team behavior to achieve business and organizational objectives probably will&#xD;
    not be apparent for a much longer time than it takes for the effects on individuals and teams to become apparent.&#xD;
    Because of this, it is important that everyone implementing and using the measurement system understand this. The&#xD;
    success of an implementation of a measurement system should never be determined in anything less than eight months to a&#xD;
    year. It takes time for changes at the lowest level of an organization to show sustained benefit at the organization&#xD;
    and business levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The results and recommendations are usually documented in a Measurement Assessment.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The assessment of the infrastructure for the measurement system is the easiest element to evaluate. The tools and their&#xD;
    configuration either work or they do not. They either efficiently support automatic collections or they do not. Take&#xD;
    corrective action immediately to resolve any issues associated with infrastructure. Languishing infrastructure issues&#xD;
    (connection, performance, down time, and so forth) kill any attempt at establishing a measurement system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations have much fewer problems with the infrastructure if they deploy the measurement system to the&#xD;
    organization incrementally and pilot the use of each increment before moving the contents out to the broader&#xD;
    population. Some metrics will not be affected. However, those showing trends over time are extremely vulnerable to lack&#xD;
    of confidence when there are issues that arise that could have been resolved on a small scale early.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The longer it takes to show growth toward organizational and business objectives, the less likely the measurement&#xD;
    system will continue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessing the configuration and infrastructure should include items such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issues with the hardware and software for the measurement system&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issues with hardware down time&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Issues with availability of metric reports&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Correctness of the derived measures&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Usability of the metric reports&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Timeliness of the metric reports&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The measurement process (who, what, how, and when) needs to be evaluated regularly. As businesses and IT organizations&#xD;
    change, so should the content of their multi-tiered measurement system that supports them. As the business changes, or&#xD;
    as IT changes, the focus may shift from one set of&amp;nbsp;organizational objectives to another. To measure the impact of&#xD;
    the changes associated with these new objectives, an additional or a different set of measures may need to be used.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>A note of caution:&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Changing a measurement system too much, too soon or too often will send the message that the newest measurement set is&#xD;
    simply another &lt;em>measure of the month&lt;/em>. Before deploying too much change too soon, it is advisable that the&#xD;
    current set of measures have demonstrated achievement of the goals set for them (for example, institutionalizing a set&#xD;
    of practices and techniques, deployment of a suite of tools across the entire organization, and so on).&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assess the understanding of those who are using the deployed metrics. This includes understanding and proper use at all&#xD;
    levels of the IT organization. The effectiveness of a deployed performance system increases with its use; nonetheless,&#xD;
    many attempts at sustaining a measurement system have failed due to the lack of use and commitment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any metric not used should be removed. Therefore, project teams and management must use the metrics for what they were&#xD;
    intended. The purpose of a performance measurement system is to provide a mechanism for reasoning about the&#xD;
    effectiveness of a change effort and the efficiency of tools and people towards achievement of business goals. Periodic&#xD;
    assessments should occur if for no other reason than it sends a clear statement from management that the measurement&#xD;
    system is important. This will not allow it to become forgotten and useless.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not having a vibrant multi-tiered measurement system gives rise to the questions of value that are directed internally&#xD;
    toward organizations as a whole and at people, processes, and tools in particular. To create and maintain a vibrant&#xD;
    measurement system requires commitment by everyone at all levels in IT. A programmer or a technical writer may not be&#xD;
    that interested in a metric about meeting milestones or a metric related to project financials, but they should be made&#xD;
    aware of what changes they may need to make or that the organization needs to make to create a flexible organization&#xD;
    that provides value to the business. It is the business that provides the work environment, and it is the role of IT to&#xD;
    support the business in meeting its objectives.&#xD;
