  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A multi-tiered measurement system is deployed in an incremental or phased approach. Start with a pilot approach to&#xD;
    validate a set of derived measures within an environment to capture best practices specific to a particular&#xD;
    organization or culture. By piloting the measurement system, the development team identifies improvements before&#xD;
    deploying to the larger organization. This learning provides a loop back to the team (management and staff) that is&#xD;
    responsible for the measurement system. It also works out issues that make a change difficult.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After adjustments from a pilot deployment, make the measures available to a broader audience. This can be by line of&#xD;
    business, department, project types or whatever makes sense for the organization. The size of the organization affects&#xD;
    the speed at which the measurement system can be effectively deployed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using a pilot approach to deploy a measurement system across an organization allows the measurement team to understand&#xD;
    the needs for resources and effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is used to plan each increment of the rollout. Before any incremental rollout, develop a plan that&#xD;
    identifies tasks and responsible resources for key stages:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hardware setup, software installation steps, and verification for individual teams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training of project team members and management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of the measurement system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The identified tasks should be integrated into the overall project plan for the deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To assist in getting agreement, clearly articulate the business and organizational objectives that the measurement&#xD;
    system supports. Explain why that is important to the business, to the organization, and to each individual. Get&#xD;
    agreement on these goals along with interim checkpoints for showing progress on longer efforts, typically more than 30&#xD;
    days ahead.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Train whoever is required to maintain, analyze, and report on the metrics. Typically, this does not require a&#xD;
    significant amount of time for any single individual. Consider these elements when deciding on the necessary training:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation, upgrades, problem solving for associated hardware and software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any manual collection and calculations necessary to produce a metric&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Creation of reports for displaying derived measures, including changes to organizational templates at both the&#xD;
        management and project levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to include metric reports in project status reporting, along with appropriate timing and interpretation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Appropriate understanding that can be drawn from each&amp;nbsp;derived measure&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of aggregated values from across multiple projects and the appropriate interpretations for these indicators&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Relationships between measures and their tracing to organizational and business goals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not everyone needs to be trained on every aspect of the measurement system, and not everyone needs to be&amp;nbsp;trained.&#xD;
    Focus on those who are responsible for maintenance, reporting, or analysis of the metrics.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Depending on the organization, it may be necessary to provide support to those who are defining, implementing, analyzing,&#xD;
and reporting on the measurement system. Also, do a quick assessment of those who need mentoring so that they can make the&#xD;
appropriate decisions before deploying the measurement system. When deploying in an incremental fashion to an organization,&#xD;
a quick assessment should be part of the planning for each increment.</sectionDescription>
