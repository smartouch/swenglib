  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design is all about optimization and making trade offs. Whenever you optimize one aspect, you necessarily de-optimize&#xD;
    another. Accordingly, you must be clear on how important the relative design criteria are. Is memory size more&#xD;
    important than worst case speed? Which is more important - ease of maintenance or improved throughput achieved through&#xD;
    the use of a complex algorithm? Are safety considerations more or less important than recurring cost (i.e. cost per&#xD;
    shipped system)? Once the criteria are ranked in order of criticality, design approaches that optimize the more&#xD;
    important criteria at the expense of the least important can be selected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The ranking of design criteria is very important and greatly affects the outcome of the system because design&#xD;
    optimization is all about trade-offs between what is most and least important. Carefully rank the design criteria that&#xD;
    are involved in your subsystem.&#xD;
