  <mainDescription>The PIM is an evolving artifact. It realizes use cases and becomes increasingly complete and complex as the&#xD;
design&amp;nbsp;iterations add more functionality.</mainDescription>
  <sections xmi:id="_AmoGAOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw" name="Is the PIM organized around collaborations?" guid="_AmoGAOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw">
    <sectionDescription>The PIM should be a coherent set of collaborations, each collaboration typically realizing a single use case. Note that the&#xD;
collaborations may share elements.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_J_ItgOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw" name="Does the PIM only contain essential elements?" guid="_J_ItgOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw">
    <sectionDescription>The PIM should represent the essential semantic elements - represented in classes, objects, relations, states, activities,&#xD;
messages, and sequences. It should not contain technology, design, or optimization decisions. Those can be found in the&#xD;
Platform Specific Model.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_Lz9hIOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw" name="Does the PIM contain one or more structural views?" guid="_Lz9hIOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw">
    <sectionDescription>The PIM should contain at least one class (or structure) diagram showing the elements and their relations.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_OXRycOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw" name="Does the PIM contain multiple scenario views showing the interaction of the collaborating elements?" guid="_OXRycOIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw">
    <sectionDescription>The PIM should contain a set of sequence (or communication or timing) diagrams showing how the contained elements&#xD;
collaborate over time.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_SZqp0OIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw" name="Does the PIM contain relevant behavioral views?" guid="_SZqp0OIuEd-aTvH4QbT1dw">
    <sectionDescription>The PIM should depict the behavior of all stateful classes in state machines, and all non-trivial algorithms in activity&#xD;
diagrams. Each state and activity model should be in a separate diagram.</sectionDescription>
