  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Safety is defined as&amp;nbsp;&quot;freedom from accidents or losses&quot; whereas reliability is &quot;a stochastic measure of the&#xD;
    availability of services from a system.&quot; Both of these concerns are managed through the administration of redundancy.&#xD;
    The safety and reliability architecture is concerned with correct functioning in the presence of faults and errors.&#xD;
    Heterogeneous redundancy (also known as diverse redundancy) is used to provide protection from failures and errors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reliability is a measure of the up-time or availability of a system--specifically, it is the probability that a&#xD;
    computation will successfully complete before the system fails. It is normally estimated with mean time between failure&#xD;
    (MTBF).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Redundancy is one design approach that increases availability because if one component fails, another takes its place.&#xD;
    Of course, redundancy only improves reliability when the failures of the redundant components are independent. The&#xD;
    reliability of a component does not depend on what happens after the component fails. Whether the system fails safely&#xD;
    or not, the reliability of the system remains the same.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Safety is distinct from reliability. A safe system is one that does not incur too much risk to persons or equipment. A&#xD;
    risk is an event or condition that can occur but is undesirable. Risk is the product of the severity of the incident&#xD;
    and its probability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key to managing both safety and reliability is redundancy. For improving reliability, redundancy allows the system&#xD;
    to continue to work in the presence of faults because other system elements can take up the work of the broken one. For&#xD;
    improving safety, additional elements are needed to monitor the system to ensure that it is operating properly; other&#xD;
    elements may be needed to either shut down the system in a safe way or take over the required functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Normally, this view is represented structurally with class or structure diagrams; the interaction of the system&#xD;
    elements to achieve safety and/or reliability goals are shown on sequence diagrams; the behavior of individual classes&#xD;
    or objects are depicted with state machines; the logical relation between faults, conditions, and failure events is&#xD;
    shown as a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) diagram; the reliability as a function of failure modes is shown as an FMEA; the&#xD;
    relation between the faults, corrective measures, risks, and hazards is shown in a Hazard Analysis.&#xD;
