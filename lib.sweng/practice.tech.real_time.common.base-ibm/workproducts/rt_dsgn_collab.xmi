  <mainDescription>A collaboration is a set of object roles (typed by classes) that are interrelated by relations (e.g. association,&#xD;
aggregation, composition, generalization, and dependencies) so that they work together to achieve a larger-scale behavior.&#xD;
In an object analysis model (PIM), the collaboration captures the essential object roles, attributes, operations, states,&#xD;
events, and relations that must be present for the collaboration to properly semantically model the problem. In a design&#xD;
model (PSM), the collaboration is optimized against the various design constraints.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The design collaboration (part of the PSM) starts life as the analysis collaboration but is optimized by applying selected&#xD;
design patterns to it. Thus, the design collaboration executes and can replicate the use case scenario functionality but&#xD;
also meets the QoS and other design constraints required of the system.</keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The purpose of a collaboration is to specify how internal elements of a system work together to realize a larger-scale&#xD;
functionality, most commonly a use case. A design collaboration not only realizes the functional behavior of the user case&#xD;
(and of its associated analysis collaboration) but is also optimized against the QoS requirements and other design&#xD;
constraints.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>The design collaboration explicitly represents the PSM version of the analysis collaboration. Not representing the design&#xD;
collaboration means that it is difficult to understand, view, or modify the design patterns representing the PSM decisions.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>If the production of the design model is done entirely via a&amp;nbsp;translative approach, then the design collaboration may&#xD;
only be implicitly represented if the translator produces the PSI (Platform Specific Implementation) directly.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
