  <mainDescription>A collaboration is a set of object roles (typed by classes) that are interrelated by relations (e.g. association,&#xD;
aggregation, composition, generalization, and dependencies) so that they work together to achieve a larger-scale behavior.&#xD;
In an object analysis model (PIM), the collaboration captures the essential object roles, attributes, operations, states,&#xD;
events, and relations that must be present for the collaboration to properly semantically model the problem. In a design&#xD;
model (PSM), the collaboration is optimized against the various design constraints.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Don't add design patterns to an analysis (PIM) collaborations, or if you must, then it should be the simplest one that&#xD;
    meets the functional need. PIM collaborations do not contain threads either, as this is another design concern. In the&#xD;
    PSM, those aspects are added to optimize the execution of the PSM.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The analysis collaboration should execute and be able to replicate all the use case scenarios via execution, but will&#xD;
    usually be sub-optimal in performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The purpose of a collaboration is to specify how internal elements of a system work together to realize a larger-scale&#xD;
functionality, most commonly a use case. An analysis collaboration should execute and realize all the functional&#xD;
requirements of the use case it realizes.</purpose>
