  <mainDescription>Architecture is a part of design, and as such, it is concerned almost exclusively with &lt;em>optimization&lt;/em>. The scope of&#xD;
architecture is system-wide and so the scope of this optimization has the same breadth.&amp;nbsp; The architecture represents&#xD;
the &lt;em>strategic design decisions&lt;/em> of the system.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The design is intended to optimize aspects of the analysis model; in terms of architectural design, this means that the&#xD;
    selected design patterns must support the analysis model functionality but orchestrate and organize it so that it can&#xD;
    execute in an optimal way - optimal, that is, in terms of the ranked set of design criteria.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should explicitly name and rank the design criteria to make sure you are making good architecture decisions. Take&#xD;
    care not to optimize the system too early as this can lead to sub-optimal architectures that are difficult to change&#xD;
    downstream.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The architecture describes the key strategic design decisions that affect most or all of the system.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>An architecture is an essential aspect of a system design, capturing the strategic design decisions. If missing, the system&#xD;
is un-optimized, unorganized and will both fail to meet its design constraints and be impossible to maintain over the long&#xD;
term.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>It is best to present the architecture as a model with one or more views, each focusing of different aspects of the&#xD;
architecture.</representationOptions>
