  <mainDescription>This work product&amp;nbsp;states the purpose and scope of the work to be done during the next microcycle. This includes the&#xD;
functionality and risks to be addressed, architectural intent, target platforms, and external elements needed. This gives&#xD;

  <purpose>The purpose this work product is to provide guidance and focus to the development and test staff involved with the&#xD;
prototype development and the work to be done during the microcycle.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without the mission statement, different developers may have different concepts as to what is included within the prototype&#xD;
or the target platforms to be supported. This confusion can lead to wasted effort and rework.</impactOfNotHaving>
