  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template, the style of reuse is very informal and ad-hoc. The reuse scope is targeted for the&#xD;
    specific community, with no governance boards or policies. There are resources committed to managing the repository,&#xD;
    but the asset production and reuse is ad-hoc at best. The use of assets is opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Many organizations begin their asset work using a organization template similar to this one. A challenge of this style&#xD;
    of asset-based development is to produce sufficient results and benefits to warrant migrating to a more formal&#xD;
    structure. Sometimes some level of structure is needed to capture and report benefits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another challenge for this template is the potential for the repository to become a junkyard of assets. With no&#xD;
    governance the asset producers feel that their assets are reusable and the needs of the consumers are not directly&#xD;
    considered or are assumed. Pretty soon the repository is rendered useless.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The proper use of this template is to use it as a starting point on the road to a governed repository. If the&#xD;
    enterprise uses this for a period of time to gather lessons learned and then move on, this template can fulfill that&#xD;
    purpose quite well.&#xD;
