    In this organization template, asset governance is centrally funded with one or more asset governance boards whose&#xD;
    policies cross many communities for the enterprise. The reuse scope is at the community level still, and each community&#xD;
    funds and manages their own repository. The asset production is formalized with committed resources, which adhere to&#xD;
    the governance policies. The community subject matter experts are close to the asset production activities, and often&#xD;
    are the ones who produce the assets, or work closely with the asset production team. The use of assets is planned and&#xD;
    opportunistic. Those who produce the assets follow key assets into the context of the asset consumers to help insure&#xD;
    their success, as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key differentiator between this template and the Self-Governed Community template is the asset production is funded,&#xD;
    supporting both the development and maintenance of key assets. This affects the asset consumer's ability to plan for&#xD;
    reuse in their projects, allowing them to put more trust in the asset's availability and support.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another key differentiator is that the use of the assets is supported by the asset producers. This means the asset&#xD;
    producers help the asset consumers be successful with using the asset. This may be performed directly by the asset&#xD;
    producers or it may be through an enablement team. This support has a direct benefit to the asset consumers and their&#xD;
    projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When assets are more complex and will be used multiple times, there is generally some justification for providing&#xD;
    higher levels of support. The time to achieve a return on investment for assets can be decreased in this template and&#xD;
    the remaining more formal templates (Enterprise Partial, Enterprise Full) through the proper use of asset support,&#xD;
    enabling the success of the consumers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A governed community can interoperate with self-governed communities as well. The governance boards for the governed&#xD;
    communities provides policies for the self-governed community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
