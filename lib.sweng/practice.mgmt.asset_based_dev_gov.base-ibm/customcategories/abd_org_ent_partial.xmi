    In this organization template the asset governance is centrally funded and controlled. The asset repository and&#xD;
    management is also centrally funded and managed, implementing governance policies. But the asset production is&#xD;
    formalized in the respective communities, where the domain expertise resides. The reuse scope is at the community,&#xD;
    cross-community, and enterprise level. The domain experts from the communities produce the assets or work with asset&#xD;
    production teams in the communities. Those who produce the assets follow key assets into the context of the asset&#xD;
    consumers to help insure their success, as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line. The asset use is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    alt=&quot;In this organization template the asset-based governance is centrally funded and controlled.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_enterpartial.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key differentiator from this template and the Governed Community is the separation of asset production and asset&#xD;
    management. The functions around asset management require some overhead, and the organization can achieve some&#xD;
    efficiency by centralizing them. Meanwhile the asset production activities are benefited by staying within the&#xD;
    community, being close to the domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This template also promotes the use of asset experts helping asset consumers be successful with using the assets. Not&#xD;
    all assets require this, but when the reuse costs of key assets can be mitigated with proper support, then the value of&#xD;
    the asset and the repository is preserved, or perhaps increases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many situations there will be a modified structure from the one shown above. The enterprise will not all be on the&#xD;
    same, single organizational structure for the reuse scope, but rather it will be a mixture of templates as shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this example the central asset governance board provides the policies to the asset governance board in the modified&#xD;
    self-governed community. The central asset governance board also provides policies to one or more governed communities,&#xD;
    each of which manage their own repositories and asset production and the funding associated with them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The example could be modified further to reflect migrations from the community repositories to the centrally managed&#xD;
    repository as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 801px; HEIGHT: 468px&quot; height=&quot;468&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;Modified template reflecting the migration of the community repositories.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_enterpartial_modified.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
