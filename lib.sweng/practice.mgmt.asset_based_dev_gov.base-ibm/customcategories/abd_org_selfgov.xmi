    In this organization template, the community supports asset governance, dictating the policies and structure by which&#xD;
    the assets in the community comply. One or more governance boards are established and funded by the community. The&#xD;
    reuse scope is at the community level, which may be a team, or a project. The community funds resources to administer&#xD;
    the asset repository. There is no formal asset production team, but it is expected that those who produce assets will&#xD;
    comply with the policies from asset governance. The use of assets is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    If the enterprise has started with the Ad-Hoc Community the Self-Governed Community is often the next template to be&#xD;
    used. This template introduces governance for the reuse scope, which in this template is a single community.&#xD;
    Introducing governance represents a growth in asset-based development maturity for the community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This template has many of the characteristics as the more formal templates such as Enterprise Partial or Enterprise&#xD;
    Full. However, it varies in reuse scope and in the size and number of communities involved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key difference for this template compared to the Ad-Hoc Community template is that the asset consumers can conduct&#xD;
    planned reuse, as well as opportunistic reuse. Planned reuse means that the governance policies establish the asset&#xD;
    version policies, asset types and categorizations that the repository will support. However, in this template the&#xD;
    community doesn't fund the assets produced, or supported for that matter, so the planned asset reuse is mitigated by&#xD;
    that.&#xD;
