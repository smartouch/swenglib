    In this organization template the asset governance is centrally funded and controlled. The asset repository and&#xD;
    management is also centrally funded and managed. The asset production is also centrally managed, and domain experts&#xD;
    from the communities participate in the central production team. The reuse scope is at the community, cross-community&#xD;
    and enterprise level. In this organization template the experts from the centralized asset production team follow key&#xD;
    assets into the communities to help ensure success using the assets (as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line in the image). The&#xD;
    asset use is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    alt=&quot;The asset manufacturing is also centrally managed, and community experts participate in the central manufacturing team.&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key differentiator between this template and the Enterprise Partial template is the asset production activities are&#xD;
    centralized as well. To make an asset reusable, and to reduce the friction in reuse transactions, there often is some&#xD;
    packaging and other overhead activities required across assets. For certain kinds of assets, such as coarse-grained&#xD;
    solutions which comprises many assets it may be justified to centralize the production and packaging of the assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A challenge with this template is the asset production may be performed organizationally too distant from the domain&#xD;
    experts in the communities. This has be monitored closely and communication must be constant. The majority of the&#xD;
    asset-based development work, including the configuration of the repositories and the development of the assets must be&#xD;
    done within the context and purpose of positively impacting the asset consumers. Anything that causes a hurdle or a gap&#xD;
    to not understand the asset consumers clearly should be removed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many situations there will be a modified structure from the one shown above. The enterprise will not all be on the&#xD;
    same, single organizational structure for the reuse scope, but rather it will be a mixture of templates as shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this example the central asset governance board provides the policies to the asset governance board in the modified&#xD;
    self-governed community. The central asset governance board also provides policies to one or more governed communities,&#xD;
    each of which manage their own repositories and asset production and the funding associated with them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The example could be modified further to reflect migrations from the community repositories to the centrally managed&#xD;
    repository as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
