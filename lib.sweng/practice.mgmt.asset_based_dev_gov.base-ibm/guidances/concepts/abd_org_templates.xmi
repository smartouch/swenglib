  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The enterprise needs to determine the organizational structure for supporting asset governance and development. The&#xD;
    enterprise may use a less rigorous style or may pursue a heavily governed approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several asset governance and development organization templates to choose from. These are intended to&#xD;
    represent major characteristics, and to be adjusted to meet the needs of the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several characteristics describing each organization template, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Reuse scope&lt;/strong>: the intended reuse visibility, either the reuse is targeted within the community or&#xD;
        across multiple communities at the enterprise level&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Governance board&lt;/strong>: the number and kind of governance boards, where they sit in the organization,&#xD;
        and who funds them&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Domain experts&lt;/strong>: from where do the subject matter experts come to support asset manufacturing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Produce&lt;/strong>: the location and resources creating, updating, supporting assets, and who funds them&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong>: the location of the resources managing the repository and who funds them&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Use&lt;/strong>: the techniques and formality for reuse; the use of assets may be planned and/or&#xD;
        opportunistic; planned use of assets implies the governance boards and those producing assets prepare the assets&#xD;
        and policies with the knowledge of targeted consumers' needs, and those consumers have direction to use assets as&#xD;
        part of their work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization templates are presented in increasing order of formality. There are pros and cons to each of the&#xD;
    templates. The templates should be considered as starting points&amp;nbsp;that you can refine to meet the needs of your&#xD;
    enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is a loose relationship between the maturity of an organization and the specific template to use. Maturity&#xD;
    includes several key principles such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process maturity, the organization's processes are formalized and executed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        cultural acceptance of assets and reuse has been attained&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reuse opportunities exist within the named reuse scope&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        funding and sponsorship has been determined&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A mature organization has improved operational success with asset governance and asset-based development in the more&#xD;
    formal organization templates presented here. However, a mature organization may determine to start with less formal&#xD;
    organization templates and migrate to more formal organization templates when ready, whereas a less mature organization&#xD;
    should stay with the less formal organization templates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The less formal organization templates presented below include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ad-Hoc Community&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Self-Governed Community&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The more formal organization templates presented below include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Governed Community&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise Partial&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise Full&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Organization Template: Ad-Hoc Community&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template, the style of reuse is very informal and ad-hoc. The reuse scope is targeted for the&#xD;
    specific community, with no governance boards or policies. There are resources committed to managing the repository,&#xD;
    but the asset production and reuse is ad-hoc at best. The use of assets is opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;151&quot; alt=&quot;In this organization template the style of reuse is very informal and ad-hoc&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_adhoccomm.gif&quot; width=&quot;579&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Organization Template: Self-Governed Community&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template, the community supports asset governance, dictating the policies and structure by which&#xD;
    the assets in the community comply. One or more governance boards are established and funded by the community. The&#xD;
    reuse scope is at the community level, which may be a team, or a project. The community funds resources to administer&#xD;
    the asset repository. There is no formal asset production team, but it is expected that those who produce assets will&#xD;
    comply with the policies from asset governance. The use of assets is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;231&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;The community supports ABD governance, dictating the policies and structure by which the assets in the community comply.&quot;&#xD;
     src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_selfgovcomm.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Organization Template: Governed Community&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template, asset governance is centrally funded with one or more asset governance boards whose&#xD;
    policies cross many communities for the enterprise. The reuse scope is at the community level still, and each community&#xD;
    funds and manages their own repository. The asset production is formalized with committed resources, which adhere to&#xD;
    the governance policies. The community subject matter experts are close to the asset production activities, and often&#xD;
    are the ones who produce the assets, or work closely with the asset production team. The use of assets is planned and&#xD;
    opportunistic. Those who produce the assets follow key assets into the context of the asset consumers to help insure&#xD;
    their success, as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;284&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;ABD governance is centrally funded with one or more asset governance boards and its policies cross many communities for the enterprise.&quot;&#xD;
     src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_govcomm.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Organization Template: Enterprise Partial&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template the asset governance is centrally funded and controlled. The asset repository and&#xD;
    management is also centrally funded and managed, implementing governance policies. But the asset production is&#xD;
    formalized in the respective communities, where the domain expertise resides. The reuse scope is at the community,&#xD;
    cross-community, and enterprise level. The domain experts from the communities produce the assets or work with asset&#xD;
    production teams in the communities. Those who produce the assets follow key assets into the context of the asset&#xD;
    consumers to help insure their success, as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line. The asset use is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;In this organization template the asset-based governance is centrally funded and controlled.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/orgtemp_enterpartial.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Organization Template: Enterprise Full&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this organization template the asset governance is centrally funded and controlled. The asset repository and&#xD;
    management is also centrally funded and managed. The asset production is also centrally managed, and domain experts&#xD;
    from the communities participate in the central production team. The reuse scope is at the community, cross-community&#xD;
    and enterprise level. In this organization template the experts from the centralized asset production team follow key&#xD;
    assets into the communities to help ensure success using the assets (as noted by the &quot;support&quot; line in the image). The&#xD;
    asset use is planned and opportunistic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;252&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;The asset manufacturing is also centrally managed, and community experts participate in the central manufacturing team.&quot;&#xD;
