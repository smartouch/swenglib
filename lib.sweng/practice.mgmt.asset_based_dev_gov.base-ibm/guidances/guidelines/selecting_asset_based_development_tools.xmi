&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to select tools that support the asset-based development activities, so that these activities do not&#xD;
    reduce the productivity of the team in any way. Also, the availability of tools that provide value and are easy to use&#xD;
    will increase the probability that the asset-based development activities will be performed..&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The selected tools should support the asset-based development activities and meet the needs of your organization. The&#xD;
    type of tooling that is provided is highly dependent on the types of assets that your&amp;nbsp;organization will be working&#xD;
    with. The possible asset types should be considered when selecting the tooling.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several kinds of tools to consider when setting up the asset-based development and management environment. In&#xD;
    the image below, the Reusable Asset repository (referred to as repository) and the IDE are critical ones for the&#xD;
    Development time environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Critical tools for development-time environment: the Reusable Asset repository and the IDE.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/dev_runtime.jpg&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the image above, reusable asset repository may include design, code, or anything that is reusable; configuration&#xD;
    management repository may include versioned artifacts and views; change management repository may include activities&#xD;
    and tasks; portfolio data ware house includes project summary data, financial data, and resource data; project&#xD;
    repositories/workspaces may include requirements, code, tests, assigned tasks, build results, defects, etc.;&#xD;
    configuration management database includes machines, operating systems, databases, and applications; service registry&#xD;
    include descriptions of deployed services and composite applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These guidelines provide recommendations for selecting tools that support asset-based development. The project-specific&#xD;
    guidelines and process may need to be modified to reflect the selected tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Selecting_Asset_Production_Tools&quot; name=&quot;Selecting_Asset_Production_Tools&quot;>&lt;/a>Selecting Asset Production Tools&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tasks specific to asset production include creating (or harvesting) the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/asset_artifact_C676F1CD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{496C68F1-53D1-4DE7-A5FF-44FAD9252AC4}&quot;>Artifact: Asset Artifact&lt;/a>s that will make up the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.asset_based_dev.base-ibm/workproducts/reusable_asset_A38D118D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B40F6CE7-C2CF-49DB-A805-2FBDC885102D}&quot;>asset&lt;/a>, and packaging the asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some tools to consider for each of the asset consumption tasks are as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Asset Artifact Development&lt;/b>. The tools that support the development and harvesting of the Asset Artifacts are&#xD;
        dependent on the type of artifacts being created. In most cases, such tools already exist, as they are usually the&#xD;
        same tools as those used for developing other projects in the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Asset Packaging&lt;/b>. The tools that support packaging the asset should understand and support the semantics of&#xD;
        the standard format in which the asset is to be packaged in (that is, it embodies and supports the format's&#xD;
        well-formedness rules). In that way, it reduces (ideally eliminates) the possibility of an improperly formed asset.&#xD;
        Also, the tool should make it easy to locate, browse, and include in the asset package, the individual artifacts.&#xD;
        The tool should highlight what remaining documentation is needed to complete the asset, as well as provide&#xD;
        validation checks for completeness.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some tools to consider for each of the asset consumption tasks are as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Asset Location&lt;/b>. The Asset Consumer needs tools to search for assets, browse them and conduct fit analysis,&#xD;
        and ultimately choose to acquire the asset. The supporting tooling can include Web browsers for searching and&#xD;
        browsing assets. Depending on the size and complexity of the asset a Web browser may be sufficient for conducting&#xD;
        fit analysis. Or, an evaluation version of the asset may need to be secured and used in point tools to conduct fit&#xD;
        analysis. Acquiring the asset also takes multiple paths as some assets may be downloaded online whereas others may&#xD;
        require significant financial transactions and other media to acquire the asset.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Asset Application&lt;/b>. The Asset Consumer needs tools to install and customize the asset. This tooling varies&#xD;
        widely depending on the types of asset. Applying an asset may be as simple as opening a requirements document and&#xD;
        customizing it for your needs. Or, it may be more complex, such as installing and extending an application&#xD;
        framework.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Asset Rating&lt;/b>. In many cases the way in which an asset is rated may be less dependent on the type of the&#xD;
        asset and more dependent on the asset library. Rating an asset provides feedback and change requests, and is often&#xD;
        implemented as part of the asset library.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Understanding Target Environment, Topology and Hardware&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A critical part of selecting tools for asset-based development is to understand the target environment where the asset&#xD;
    repository will be hosted. There are several topologies to consider for the asset repository, with two simple ones&#xD;
    presented here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the first topology, shown&amp;nbsp;below, the asset repository server is on a clustered application server at a central&#xD;
    site. There is one database with which the asset repository server communicates, along with source configuration&#xD;
    management (SCM) support and other necessary integrations. The remote sites deploy just the clients to the asset&#xD;
    repository server, but replicate SCM locally on each site. This topology has the benefit of lower technical support&#xD;
    staff in remote locations, but requires higher bandwidth for asset-based development scenarios between the remote site&#xD;
    and the central site.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;img alt=&quot;Topology where the asset repository server is on a clustered application server at a central site.&quot;&#xD;
src=&quot;./resources/repository_topology1.gif&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another topology to consider is shown below. This topology has the benefit of distributing the computing for&#xD;
    asset-based development scenarios to the remote sites with replicated SCM support. Asset searching and asset retrieval&#xD;
    will perform faster in remote sites, while asset browsing of the metadata, which requires asset repository DB support&#xD;
    still requires decent network bandwidth. This topology requires more administrative support in the remote sites as&#xD;
    well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Distributed topology with replicted SCM support.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/repository_topology2.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;298&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are certainly many other topologies to consider. In short the enterprise needs to determine the level of&#xD;
    replication of indexes, metadata, and asset artifacts to promote across the remote sites to support performant&#xD;
    asset-based development scenarios, balanced with the cost of delivering that capability.&#xD;
