  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;introduction to&amp;nbsp;Asset-Based Development&amp;nbsp;provides a high-level overview of the tasks supporting&#xD;
    Asset Governance and how they impact the Asset-based Development process. Many of the Governance tasks produce work&#xD;
    products which serve as input to the Asset-based Development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;The relationship between ABD and ABD Governance.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/asset_gov_gettingstarted.gif&quot; width=&quot;431&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;327&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset-based Development process as configured out of the box can be used without using the Asset Governance&#xD;
    process. This is useful in situations where the enterprise is still working out the adoption and commitment to more&#xD;
    robust asset processes. However, the Asset Governance process has connections and links to the Asset-based Development&#xD;
    process, requiring it to be present.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Governance and Asset-based Development processes can be applied to multiple asset domains. In particular&#xD;
    these processes map to the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) space. Elements of SOA Governance can be addressed with&#xD;
    the Asset Governance process as shown in the image below. Elements of the SOA Lifecycle can be addressed with the&#xD;
    Asset-based Development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;ABD in the context of the SOA Lifecycle.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/asset_governance_andsoa.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;416&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of the Asset Governance phases provides work products or task mappings into the Asset-based Development process.&#xD;
    These mappings are introduced below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Asset Governance Planning phase multiple work products can be produced. These work products include the Reuse&#xD;
    Assessment and the Reuse Strategy. These and other work products influence the configuration of the repository. They&#xD;
    also influence the major capability patterns such as how assets will be produced, or consumed, or managed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Relationship between Planning and ABD.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/assetgov_planning_abd_map.gif&quot; width=&quot;426&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;140&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The major asset workflow are identified in this phase but are not described in detail, this occurs in the next phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Asset Governance Definition phase multiple work products can be produced. These work products include the&#xD;
    Community Map and Asset Workflow Specification as well as Asset Version Policy, and others. These and other work&#xD;
    products influence the configuration of the repository and the major asset-based development workflows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Relationship between Definition and ABD.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/assetgov_definition_abd_map.gif&quot; width=&quot;427&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;159&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Governance and Organization Workflow is specified in this phase. This workflow describes the organizational&#xD;
    structure that will be put in place to support Asset-based Development capability patterns listed in this image.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Asset Governance Enablement phase multiple work products are used to create the training and incentive plans.&#xD;
    The roles for supporting Asset-based Development are refined, and the training and incentive plans are exercised and&#xD;
    validated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Relationship between Enablement and ABD.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/assetgov_enablement_abd_map.gif&quot; width=&quot;454&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;173&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some work products are reused in this phase. As the enablement rolls out to the teams, the Reuse Strategy should be&#xD;
    refined as needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Asset Governance Measurement phase the metrics and reporting work products are created. These serve as input to&#xD;
    the repository administrators in Asset-based Development to produce the proper reports and measurements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Relationship between Measurement and ABD.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/assetgov_measurement_abd_map.gif&quot; width=&quot;428&quot;&#xD;
    height=&quot;125&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Asset Governance process establishes the work products and policies by which the Asset-based Development process&#xD;
    complies.&#xD;
