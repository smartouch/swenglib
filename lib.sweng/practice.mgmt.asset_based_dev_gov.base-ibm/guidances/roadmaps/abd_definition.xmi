  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The enterprise needs to define the assets that are most important and beneficial to track. Everything else should be in&#xD;
    support of that decision. The assets for the enterprise should provide value, they should be used, they should not sit&#xD;
    dormant in the repository, if so, they should be removed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To accomplish this the Asset Governance Board needs to be created. This board, or boards, owns the responsibilities of&#xD;
    many of the decisions defining the assets and the repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With the reuse strategy and assessments created, now the attention should turn to identifying what is most important to&#xD;
    an enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One way to start this is to identify the areas in the software development process&amp;nbsp;that need some productivity&#xD;
    improvements. Looking at the roles in the enterprise&amp;nbsp;that need help, or consistency in their tasks and work&#xD;
    products are also places to look for assets to focus on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some enterprises take a top-down&amp;nbsp;approach, and begin describing the development approach and environment to which&#xD;
    they want to migrate. To take this approach, determine the objectives of the assets you will be defining, governing,&#xD;
    and supporting. Some of this motivation and objectives should come from the Reuse Strategy document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With that understood, next conduct the tasks in this section&amp;nbsp;that will address how the repository should be&#xD;
    organized, what asset types should be used, and what workflows and review processes should be in place.&#xD;
