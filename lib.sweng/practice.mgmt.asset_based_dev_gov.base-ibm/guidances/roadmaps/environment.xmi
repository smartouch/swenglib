    Asset-based development has several roles, including practitioner, which conducts asset consumption and asset&#xD;
    production activities with the repository. There are also many roles in the software development lifecycle, such as&#xD;
    analyst, architect, developer, and tester. To prepare these roles to perform the practitioner role activities (such as&#xD;
    asset production and asset consumption) examine what tools would be required to support the mix-in of these roles&#xD;
    together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tooling for asset production and consumption activities needs to be close to, and easily accessible to the way in&#xD;
    which people perform their work today. Setting up an environment which naturally extends the way people work today will&#xD;
    reduce the adoption and learning curves required for asset-based development.&#xD;
