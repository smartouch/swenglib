    Governance is the establishment of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Chains of responsibility to empower people.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measurement to gauge effectiveness.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Policies to guide the enterprise to meet its goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Control mechanisms to ensure compliance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communication to keep all required parties informed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Systematic software reuse is the purposeful creation, management, support, and reuse of assets. In &lt;i>Software Reuse:&#xD;
    Architecture, Process, and Organization for Business Success&lt;/i>, Jacobsen et al estimate the following benefits of&#xD;
    systematic reuse:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time to market: 2 to 5 times reduction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect density: 5 to 10 times reduction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maintenance cost: 5 to 10 times reduction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Often the mission of the reuse program is to help:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Continuously improve the delivery of products and services;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provide and support a world-class IT operation that meets or exceeds end-user needs;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provide end-to-end solutions that increase asset reuse and reduce software development costs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization helps to realize this mission by developing tools, processes, and policies that will establish,&#xD;
    maintain, and encourage strategic reuse.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many challenges, however, to implementing software reuse at an organization that uses a more traditional&#xD;
    development approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Asset governance includes those activities for administrating asset-based development. It sits within the broader IT&#xD;
    governance in an enterprise. The focus is on preparing the organization to properly create, use, measure, and re-plan&#xD;
    the investments in assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus areas for setting up the governance of development-time assets are illustrated in the image below. In&#xD;
    general, these tasks may be done in parallel, and the order in which they are conducted is negotiable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;The four major focus areas for asset governance includes planning, definition, enablement, and measurement.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/gov_overview.gif&quot; width=&quot;503&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The major focus areas include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Planning&lt;/strong>: Capture the governance requirements, determine which processes to bring under&#xD;
        governance, determine the measures and targets of effectiveness of the governance solutions. This focuses on what&#xD;
        out-of-the-box governance processes (content areas) to deploy, and what customizations are necessary to accommodate&#xD;
        the unique needs of the adopting organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Definition&lt;/strong>: Specify the decision rights, measures, and policies to be applied to those processes&#xD;
        under governance. Specify the automation and tool support. This focuses on&amp;nbsp;performing a&amp;nbsp;gap analysis&#xD;
        between the out-of-the-box governance process and what is needed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Enablement&lt;/strong>: Roll out the governance solution to the organization in stages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Measurement&lt;/strong>: Determine if the governance solution is meeting its effectiveness targets and make&#xD;
        adjustments as necessary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describing the focus areas for asset governance is simplified when illustrating it sequentially as shown above. In&#xD;
    practice, the activities in the focus areas are generally overlapped, as shown below. This work requires iteration and&#xD;
    refinement. As policies and strategies are created, and teams are being formed, and lessons are being learned,&#xD;
    refinement must be permitted, allowing the governance model being created to be updated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;The activities are generally overlapped and work is performed iteratively.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/gov_iteration.gif&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Governance is categorized for organizational-level practices and project-level practices. The governance practices&#xD;
    described here are focused on the organization, but directly impact the asset-based development flows. A key aspect to&#xD;
    the asset-based governance process is to specify how asset-based development will be practiced. The asset-based&#xD;
    governance tasks produce the policies and artifacts&amp;nbsp;that projects use to conduct asset-based development. In the&#xD;
    image below, the projects conduct the tasks of producing, managing, and using assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Relationships between Asset-Based Development and ABD Governance.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/abd_gov_pact1.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instead of requiring projects to produce and manage assets, the asset-based development may be structured to separate&#xD;
    these workflows by placing them in a central asset manufacturing team, leaving the projects to use the assets and&#xD;
    discover candidate assets. Each structure has benefits and drawbacks. Having a central asset manufacturing team has the&#xD;
    benefits of greater asset consistency and quality, but this generally comes at a higher cost.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process should be customized during asset-based governance to support the structure of asset-based development for&#xD;
    the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 802px; HEIGHT: 555px&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;Organizational structure where the assets are developed by a specialized team.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/abd_gov_pact2.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset-based development workflows are generally inserted into the current enterprise processes. Use or create&#xD;
    capability patterns using the process components to meet your needs.&amp;nbsp; If the enterprise is using Rational Unified&#xD;
    Process then the asset-based development processes may be inserted in any phase, or in any discipline, or within any&#xD;
    iteration, as illustrated in the image below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;The ABD workflows are inserted into the current enterprise processes.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/abd_rup.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;538&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The asset-based development workflows can be inserted into other software development processes, such as the one shown&#xD;
    below. In this example, the asset-based development workflows are inserted into each of the process phases. In some&#xD;
    cases, the business-related assets are only used on the software project and are not produced on the project, whereas&#xD;
    each of the software-related phases produce and consume assets on the project. This example does not address a&#xD;
    situation&amp;nbsp;in which&amp;nbsp;there are one or more central or cross-project asset manufacturing teams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 753px; HEIGHT: 321px&quot; alt=&quot;The ABD workflows are inserted into each of the process phases.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/abd_dmaic.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Scope&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many areas requiring governance, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Portfolio Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Program Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Strategic Reuse&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise Architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compliance Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT Planning and Oversight&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Systems Engineering&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        People Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software Process Improvement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of this governance material will be organizational-level practices for strategic reuse. The material is&#xD;
    organized according to the major focus areas introduced above: planning, definition, enablement, and measurement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Planning&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reuse strategy is created along with resource estimates and financial estimates. The financial sponsor needs to be&#xD;
    determined and funding allocated. This includes a discussion and decision on funding models.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In typical funding situations, the funds are allocated for the activities to deliver the artifacts for the project.&#xD;
    This relationship changes with the reuse model where the funding for assets and their artifacts may provide value for&#xD;
    several projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several models for funding the reuse team and related reuse efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Overhead funding: The costs for the reuse team are handled in the pool of overhead expenses.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tax funding: Each application development project pays a tax which covers the cost of the reuse team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Payments for assets&amp;nbsp;and services: The application development teams pay for the assets and services they use&#xD;
        from the reuse team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One approach is to start with overhead funding, and then shift to payments for assets&amp;nbsp;and services. The purpose&#xD;
    for this recommendation is to provide time for startup costs and then move to another funding model, such as for&#xD;
    services or assets, when the initial value has been verified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Definition&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are multiple workflows&amp;nbsp;that comprise the asset's lifecycle. For example, the activities of submitting an&#xD;
    asset to the repository, or the review and approval process, or the retirement and archiving activities. The workflows&#xD;
    need to be identified, and the key participants understood. Often you must consider the type of asset, or its&#xD;
    categorization (for a specific business domain), as well as which organizational unit owns the asset. All of these are&#xD;
    factors in determining the workflows for assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Controlling the access to assets is a key element of governance. Determining who can do what with an asset involves&#xD;
    understanding the asset's intended use and scope. Access control can be determined for assets of a given type, or of a&#xD;
    given classification, or of a given owner. These factors should be considered and the access control should be captured&#xD;
    in the repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Enablement&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The tools for conducting asset-based development should be selected and set up. Key to this is understanding which&#xD;
    roles will work with which tools throughout the asset-based development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Measurement&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying the measurements important to your organization is key to the long-term and sustainable use of assets.&#xD;
    Measurement is often tracked at several levels, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset owner and producer measurements: level of investment (hours, money, time) in an asset&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset consumer: level of benefit and value delivered to the asset user&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Repository: level of activity on the repository&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Management: value to the organization, return on investment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br /></mainDescription>
