  <mainDescription>In this task, the Resources and Training Plan is implemented for training the teams who will be using assets. As part of&#xD;
this training, you should use&amp;nbsp;the Reuse Adoption and Incentive Plan, as well as the Classification Schemas,&amp;nbsp;to&#xD;
educate the users on how to discover and use assets.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Ad-Hoc and Self-Governed Organizational Templates there is no formal selection of asset consumers. Members of&#xD;
    each community access the repository and use this as the main form of communication and feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Governed Communities Organizational Template the Asset Manufacturing Team interacts with the asset consumers.&#xD;
    The asset consumers use both the repository and their contacts with the Asset Manufacturing Team to communicate and&#xD;
    provide feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Enterprise Partial Organizational Template and Enterprise Full Organizational Template the asset consumers are&#xD;
    not formally selected. However, their needs should be understood and they work with both the repository and the Asset&#xD;
    Manufacturing Team to provide feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Ad-Hoc and Self-Governed Organizational Templates the asset consumers examine and reuse assets as needed, but&#xD;
    there is little formal support structure around the assets. The repository is the main mechanism for communicating and&#xD;
    forming the community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Governed Communities Organizational Template the asset consumers have a close association with the Asset&#xD;
    Manufacturing team. Often the members of the Asset Manufacturing team may follow an asset into an asset consumer's&#xD;
    environment (either physically or virtually) to help ensure the successful use of an asset and provide support. The&#xD;
    asset consumer can provide feedback to the repository as well as to the Asset Manufacturing team. Providing this level&#xD;
    of support for asset consumers help ensure greater success of the asset program.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Enterprise Partial Organizational Template, similar to the Governed Communities Organizational Template the&#xD;
    asset consumers have a close association with the Asset Manufacturing team in terms of receiving support from them. The&#xD;
    asset consumers interact with an enterprise repository, but work closely with their community Asset Manufacturing Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Enterprise Full Organizational Template the asset consumers work with the central Asset Manufacturing Team. In&#xD;
    this model it is critical that the asset consumers can be connected with the proper support that is relevant to their&#xD;
    community. The asset consumers need to be trained to know where they go for the enterprise repository support.&#xD;
