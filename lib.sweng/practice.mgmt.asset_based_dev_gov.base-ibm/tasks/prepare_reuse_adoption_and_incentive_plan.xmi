    &lt;strong>Incentive Plan&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Creating a reuse incentive plan is critical to the success of asset-based development. There are multiple models that&#xD;
    have been applied. A good treatment of this subject is found in the article by Robert G. Fichman (Boston College)&#xD;
    titled: Incentive Compatibility and Systematic Software Reuse. (Appeared in: Journal of Systems and Software, New York;&#xD;
    Apr 27, 2001; Vol. 57, Iss. 1; pg. 45.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Reuse Adoption&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reuse adoption is a significant issue for the enterprise. An enterprise can do all the right things for the technical&#xD;
    environment, and have the management support. However, adoption and rollout into the enterprise is where many&#xD;
    enterprises fail with assets. Best practice shows us that for the asset adoption to have a better chance of survival, a&#xD;
    mixed model is required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This means that the asset program must have top-down management support, and that the rollout of the asset program must&#xD;
    be bottom-up. The reuse program generally requires bottom-up successes where it has been proven by early adopting&#xD;
    projects in the enterprise. This may mean the rollout is slower, but the overall success tends to be greater.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is less chance of success if the adoption strategy is an enterprise-wide, top-down forced usage model. The&#xD;
    adoption strategy should be aligned closely with the efforts to capture and measure the successes and failures of the&#xD;
    reuse efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The real challenge is to manage organizational and cultural change, and this takes time to be proven and adopted.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization structure for applying asset-based development can create incentives for reuse, just as it may also&#xD;
    create dis-incentives. The top-down strategy must provide for repository structure and governance. However, the&#xD;
    bottom-up adoption of the repository is critical.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measuring repository participation is one level of incentive for practitioners. Another form of incentive is budgetary&#xD;
    impact for project leads to use the asset repository.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    With the organizational structure aligned to support the active participation of asset producers with the asset&#xD;
    consumers, both in terms of understanding their needs as well as supporting the assets, a plan can be written.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reuse adoption and incentive plan should describe:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How asset support and training will be provided by asset manufacturing teams to the asset consumers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How asset production will be performed only with the participation of asset consumer input and with the active&#xD;
        involvement of asset producers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How repository submissions and asset approvals are governed, to reduce the chance of waste in the repository&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How the successful use of assets will be communicated to the organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How financial benefits will be applied to projects and communities using assets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
