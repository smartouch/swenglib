  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The enterprise needs to determine&amp;nbsp;whether there will be one asset repository or many asset repositories.&amp;nbsp;In&#xD;
    addition,&amp;nbsp;for each asset repository, the organization of the assets, the teams, and the review processes, needs to&#xD;
    be determined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task the focus is on determining how the teams will access the assets in the repository, what sub-groups of the&#xD;
    repository will exist, and which assets will go into which sub-group, or rather Community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One deterrent to reuse for consumers is being presented with too many assets to evaluate. Decomposing the repository&#xD;
    into Communities helps&amp;nbsp;you mitigate some of this issue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Community is an arbitrary collection of users, roles, and their assets. A Community may be defined along several&#xD;
    boundaries, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Organizational unit&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Users with a common role, such as Business Analyst.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the following image the Business Analyst Community is organized according to role, the Project XYZ Community is&#xD;
    organized according to a project, and the Testing Team Community is organized according to organizational unit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;504&quot; alt=&quot;An example of a Community organization. &quot; src=&quot;./resources/teamspaces_roles.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Community becomes the primary element for organizing the repository. An asset lives in one Community. Roles and&#xD;
    permissions are specified for a Community. Review processes and other workflows are specified for Community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the Reuse Strategy and Reuse Assessment, evaluate the target audience, consumers, and participants in the asset&#xD;
    program as input to what Communities to create. A user may participate in many Communities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are some tradeoffs to consider when creating Communities. If you create too few Communities then the scope may be&#xD;
    too broad, leaving the user to navigate many assets. If you specify too many Communities then the administration costs&#xD;
    can become too burdensome for specifying access control rights, review processes, asset types, and so on for each&#xD;
    Community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A rule of thumb to follow is to create a Community for each unique set of assets over which you want specific control&#xD;
    and governance over. That control may be needed by a manager, or by a business unit, or by a customer. So, if your&#xD;
    enterprise sees value in providing a place for business analyst assets and controlling the access to and the review and&#xD;
    approval process of those assets, then it may be valuable to the enterprise to manage a Community for business&#xD;
    analysts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An administrator needs to be determined for each Community. The administrator will specify the roles, permissions,&#xD;
    review processes, and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It will take several&amp;nbsp;iterations to create the proper set of Communities. In most cases, the repository will need&#xD;
    to be configured, and then exercised for some time in order to properly refine it. It is best to start with fewer&#xD;
    Communities, and then add more as necessary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With a repository organized into sub-groups and Communities, and with roles and permissions specified, now the&#xD;
    administrator maps the users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user may participate in many roles. The user information will likely need to come from a directory system such as&#xD;
    LDAP.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A user may have many roles. A role is typically created for the repository when an identifiable set of artifacts and&#xD;
    assets for that role can be described. When considering creating a role, evaluate the asset types in the repository and&#xD;
    any Asset Type Specifications. This can both discover potential asset types as well are refine what assets and&#xD;
    artifacts the role will be working with.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The role definitions should be coordinated with appropriate stakeholders and governance boards. It is valuable to&#xD;
    understand other roles that are being proposed for the repository, as you may be able to reduce the number of role&#xD;
    names when finding similar and common roles in other Communities.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The administrator setting these permissions needs to understand the roles and potential users of a particular set of&#xD;
    assets. In general, the enterprise should control access to the intellectual property, and the artifacts&amp;nbsp;that&#xD;
    represent the investment of the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The permissions for a specific role may be scoped to assets of a particular asset type, to assets with particular&#xD;
    classifications, or to a particular asset owner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, the administrator may state that for the Business Analyst role in the Service Analysis Community, they may&#xD;
    work only with assets of type &quot;Business Process&quot; which are classified for &quot;Financial Services&quot; systems.&#xD;
