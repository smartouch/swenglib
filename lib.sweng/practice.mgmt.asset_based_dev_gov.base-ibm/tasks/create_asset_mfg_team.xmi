  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some enterprises may have formal asset creation and approval steps, with one or more asset manufacturing teams,&#xD;
    governing the process closely. Other enterprises may be less formal, without asset manufacturing teams or governance&#xD;
    around that team. Review the asset-based governance and development templates for variations on where the asset&#xD;
    manufacturing team resides.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several considerations when creating an asset manufacturing team, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Scope&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Manufacturing process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Scope&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The intended scope of the team should be defined. Will the team be responsible for creating assets for the declared&#xD;
    reuse scope at the enterprise level or the divisional level? Will the team create the assets, or is the purpose of the&#xD;
    team to clean up assets and prepare them for reuse?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the asset manufacturing team is in an organization dedicated to asset creation and promotion, such as a center of&#xD;
    excellence, then asset creation may happen just in that organization. However, asset identification and initial&#xD;
    harvesting is best done from the points where the actual artifacts have been used and proven. The asset manufacturing&#xD;
    team may then take on the responsibility of making the asset reusable, and packaging&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;for asset consumers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some enterprises may skip creating a formal manufacturing team, but rather create the governance policies, workflows,&#xD;
    and other items which are then followed by teams as they take on manufacturing as a role for some period of time. This&#xD;
    approach reduces the&amp;nbsp;direct overhead of a full-time team, but may negatively impact quality and consistency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The size and complexity of the assets, as well as the enterprise's business model for funding asset creation activities&#xD;
    need to be considered when creating asset manufacturing teams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Manufacturing Process&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Directly associated with the scope of the asset manufacturing teams mentioned&amp;nbsp;previously is the manufacturing&#xD;
    process. There are several models to consider, and two are presented here. These models use the basic producer and&#xD;
    consumer model for assets. The premise is that an organization is focused on the creation of assets and another&#xD;
    organization is focused on the usage of assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the first model, there is a formal, full-time asset manufacturing team. This team is dedicated to the specification,&#xD;
    creation, and publishing of assets. The team may specify their own assets or may take specifications and candidate&#xD;
    assets from asset consumers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this model the asset manufacturing team participates in the governance and review activities of the asset. One or&#xD;
    more governance boards may be involved. As shown in the image below there is a governance board focused on asset&#xD;
    specification, and another one on asset implementation. One or more of these governance boards are optional. As the&#xD;
    asset is approved and published in the asset repository one or more projects may use the assets. In this model, as the&#xD;
    asset is used, defects may be discovered and reported. The defect (or change management) tool is accessed by the asset&#xD;
    manufacturing team, and asset revisions are planned. The asset consumers may discover new assets, and specify them, or&#xD;
    they may optionally create candidate assets and hand them over to the manufacturing team for further refinement and&#xD;
    asset hardening.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some of the variation points in this model include the use of asset governance boards, what asset consumers submit to&#xD;
    the manufacturing team (asset specifications, candidate assets, etc.), and the number and nature of the review&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The constant element to this particular model is the existence of an asset manufacturing team which owns the assets,&#xD;
    publishes them, responds to defects, and submits updates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 774px; HEIGHT: 429px&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;In this model the asset manufacturing team participates in the governance and review activities of the asset.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/formal_manufacturing.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;429&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the second model, the main asset production responsibilities shift to the asset consumer projects. The asset&#xD;
    manufacturing team is an informal team, where participants play temporarily a role to review, approve, and publish&#xD;
    assets, but then return to their normal roles on projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This model has appeal if there is not the business model or support for the overhead of a full-time asset manufacturing&#xD;
    team. The defects are tracked by the original owners. Some challenges with this model can be lower quality, low asset&#xD;
    support, and slower turn-around time on defects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although this model has the potential benefit of rolling out faster initially, as there is typically less overall&#xD;
    coordination, it is critical that the stakeholders create the governance teams and establish the policies to minimize&#xD;
    any negative side affects of this model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some enterprises may consider beginning with this model, and then when the value of the assets for the business grow,&#xD;
    migrating to the first model presented. In the diagram below, consumer projects perform asset production. The asset&#xD;
    manufacturing team is an informal team, where participants temporarily take on review and publishing responsibilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 780px; HEIGHT: 451px&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;In the second model here the main asset production responsibilities shift to the asset consumer projects.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/informal_manufacturing.gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Training&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The teams producing assets, whether that is a formal asset manufacturing team or asset consumption projects need formal&#xD;
    training. A set of key artifacts is required as input to the task of setting up the asset manufacturing process, these&#xD;
    include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reuse Adoption and Incentive Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resources and Training Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset Rules and Policies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset Type Specification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Community Map&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Asset Workflow Specification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Classification Schema&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architects, developers, and others creating assets need to understand the policies and rules described in these&#xD;
    artifacts. The respective teams need to be trained on this material.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Ad-Hoc and Self-Governed Organizational Templates there is no formal asset manufacturing team, and so this step&#xD;
    is not relevant.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Governed Communities Organizational Template the Asset Manufacturing Team has both asset production and asset&#xD;
    management responsibilities for their respective community. The team members need expertise in the domain for the&#xD;
    community and need skills to work with members of the community to use the assets. The team needs repository&#xD;
    administration skills as each community manages their own repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Enterprise Partial Organizational Template the Asset Manufacturing Team has asset production responsibilities&#xD;
    but does not have asset management responsibilities. The team members need expertise in the domain for the community&#xD;
    and need skills to work with members of the community to use the assets. An enterprise-level team has responsibilities&#xD;
    for managing the repository.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Enterprise Full Organizational Template the Asset Manufacturing Team has both asset production and asset&#xD;
    management responsibilities for the enterprise. The team members need cross-domain skills to develop assets. The&#xD;
    challenge in this template is to bring domain expertise onto the asset manufacturing team from the respective&#xD;
    communities and to deliver assets that are relevant across multiple communities.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_qLUEQP3NEdubna2vE0o6gQ" name="Enable Training Plan for the Manufacturing Team" guid="_qLUEQP3NEdubna2vE0o6gQ">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In all organizational templates a major challenge for the asset manufacturing team is to develop assets only with major&#xD;
    involvement of the stakeholders and asset consumers. The challenge here is to avoid speculative asset development and&#xD;
    for the asset manufacturing teams to be deeply involved with their customers, the asset consumers, to verify recurring&#xD;
    problems and solutions and then to verify the usefulness of assets produced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process by which assets are produced has a direct impact on whether the assets are reusable, or if they are,&#xD;
    whether any of the consuming teams use them. The asset manufacturing team needs to work under the direction of&#xD;
    management, and management needs to enforce follow-through and measurements for potential asset consumers to verify&#xD;
    assets are being used.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both management and the asset manufacturing team must be trained on monitoring the assets which are being used, and why&#xD;
    and why not.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
