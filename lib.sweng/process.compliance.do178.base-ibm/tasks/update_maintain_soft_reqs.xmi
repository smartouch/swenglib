  <mainDescription>This task maintains the software requirements. Some of these may be directly allocated from a system requirement. Others&#xD;
may require derivation and elaboration from system requirements and update based on other forms of requirements analysis&#xD;
including use case analysis. In addition, this task establishes traceability among the system requirements, software&#xD;
requirements, and software user cases. This traceability information is used for review, impact, coverage, and completeness&#xD;
analysis.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Review the requirements specification and the traceability record to identify the functional and non-functional&#xD;
requirements that apply to the subject use case.&amp;nbsp; This information should be available in the Traceability Record as a&#xD;
result of previous work done detailing the requirements.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Some system requirements map to multiple software requirements or to combinations of software and hardware. These must be&#xD;
decomposed into derived and elaborated requirements at the software level.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Missing, incorrect, inaccurate, or inconsistent requirements are often identified after systems engineering. This step&#xD;
identifies and addresses those requirements. This may result in change requests levied against the system requirements.</sectionDescription>
