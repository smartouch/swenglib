    This task is the first step in the process of building an executable model of a use-case.&amp;nbsp; It begins with the&#xD;
    definition of a use-case block and actor(s) blocks&amp;nbsp;that represent the respective use case and associated&#xD;
    actors.&amp;nbsp; At this stage, the blocks are empty and not associated.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    Elements of this diagram are instances of SysML blocks that represent the use case and its associated actor(s).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Use-Case Block is the structural representation of a use case defined in the use-case diagram. It is used to&#xD;
    represent the formal specification of the system behavior for the use case and acts as a location for the&#xD;
    operations/functions that the use case employs. The Use-Case Block communicates with relevant Actor Blocks via&#xD;
    ports&amp;nbsp;and associated provided and required interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Actor Block is the realization of an actor that was previously identified in a system&amp;nbsp;use case diagram. An&#xD;
    actor block represents a person, or system that is external to the system under development, that interacts&#xD;
    with&amp;nbsp;the system under development&amp;nbsp;by providing the inputs to, and receiving&amp;nbsp;outputs&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    system under development.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Statechart Diagram describes the state-based behavior of a block. It aggregates the information from both the&#xD;
    activity diagram (functional flow) and the sequence diagrams (interactions with the environment), and adds the&#xD;
    event-driven block behavior to the diagram. As the &quot;language&quot; of statecharts is formally defined, the correctness and&#xD;
    completeness of the resulting behavior can be verified/validated through model execution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statechart diagrams are finite state machines that are extended by the notation of Hierarchy and Concurrency.&#xD;
    Basically, a statechart diagram is comprised of a set of states joined by transitions and various connectors. An event&#xD;
    may trigger a transition from one state to another. Actions can be performed on transitions and on state entry/exit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Use-Case&amp;nbsp;Block Statechart Diagram must reflect the functional flow captured in the use-case black-box activity&#xD;
    diagram as well as the associated use-case black-box sequence diagrams.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Activity Diagram is similar to the classic flow chart. It describes a workflow, business process, or algorithm by&#xD;
    decomposing the flow of execution into a set of actions and sub activities joined by transitions and various&#xD;
    connectors. These actions and sub activities are called activity nodes. An activity can be a simple linear sequence of&#xD;
    activity nodes or it can be a complex series of parallel activity nodes with conditional branching and concurrency.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will be multiple instances of this artifact.&amp;nbsp;During requirements analysis, &quot;black-box&quot; activity diagrams are&#xD;
    created describing the functional flows for the system as a whole.&amp;nbsp;During architectural design,&#xD;
    &quot;white-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;activity diagrams are created that show the allocation of actions to specific system elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities may be grouped and assigned to objects – e.g. subsystems. In this case, the activity diagram is split into&#xD;
    swim lanes that depict the respective responsibilities.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use case scenarios represent the interactions of the system executing the use case with the actors. Each scenario&#xD;
    represents a specific sequence of events, messages, and actions. Each of these elements captures at least part of a&#xD;
    requirement, and often more than one requirement, specifying a required or optional sequence, input and output events&#xD;
    and messages, and control and data transformations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A use case normally has between several and several dozen such scenarios and each scenario has typically several to&#xD;
    several dozen messages. The scenarios set is said to be 'minimally complete' when each functional or quality of service&#xD;
    requirement is represented on at least one scenario. Messages between the use case and the actor(s) are normally&#xD;
    represented as asynchronous events that optionally carry data. This constitutes the so-called 'logical interface'&#xD;

    A&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification is strictly the set of all relevant System Requirements for a project. This&#xD;
    set provides a complete and consistent abstract description of the solution to the problem represented by a stakeholder&#xD;
    specification or a similar artifact, and its context, at an appropriate level of abstraction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, there&amp;nbsp;may be several levels of&amp;nbsp;System Requirements Specification - for example, in some cases&#xD;
    the a single level might be enough, in others, the system must be broken-down into subsystems at various levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If more than one level of System Requirement Specification is used, then remember the following points:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each specification must be a complete and consistent description of the solution, at an appropriate level of&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs of all of the stakeholders are represented. In&#xD;
        particular, include the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system after it is&#xD;
        delivered.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide requirements and other requirements work&#xD;
        products. For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements within&#xD;
        system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or duplicated, and&#xD;
        that there is an agreed upon approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly&#xD;
        important when you separate externally mandated requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus&#xD;
        &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule impact, and level of contribution to business goals.&#xD;
        Based on your evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged, defended, and amended.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are &lt;em>very&lt;/em> expensive to perform but, when performed well,&amp;nbsp;are highly valuable. It is crucial that&#xD;
    they be performed effectively. Identified issues should be solved outside of the meeting. Subsequent reviews need only&#xD;
    go over the action lists from the meeting to ensure each issue has been appropriately addressed. This means that action&#xD;
    lists are essential artifacts for effective reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is crucial to understand that reviews are not a replacement for good modeling in the first place. One of the basic&#xD;
    requirements prior to a review is that the model &lt;em>executes properly&lt;/em>. In a PIM review, this means that it is&#xD;
    debugged and can replicate (via execution) the use case scenarios. In a PSM review, this means that the model has&#xD;
    passed formal unit testing. You should NEVER find a compilation problem in a review; it is far cheaper to have the&#xD;
    product owner find that on their own &lt;em>prior to planning the review&lt;/em> rather than find it in a room full of&#xD;
    people. The intent of the review should be to evaluate an set of already high-quality artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is also very important to &lt;em>stay focused&lt;/em> during the review. The meeting leader needs to rule with a (silk&#xD;
    covered) iron fist. Reviews are very expensive so the object is to perform the intent of the review as efficiently as&#xD;
    possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: subsequent reviews of an already-reviewed work product should focus exclusively on the action list from the&#xD;
    previous review.&#xD;

    The best way to inject quality into work products is through careful engineering and demonstration and test via&#xD;
    execution or simulation. For many of these work products, execution isn’t feasible, so reviews are a way of assessing&#xD;
    the quality of the work product. In addition, many work products must conform to guidelines, standards or templates and&#xD;
    this is most easily demonstrated through a review process. Lastly, reviews also serve to disseminate information to&#xD;
    different stakeholders about the structure, content, and quality of a work product.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A change request (CR) is typically a proposed variance from the system's current (or currently planned) behavior. It&#xD;
    can also be used for a generic piece of work that is required to support the project. Change requests may include&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A report of an error (defect)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An enhancement request&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Change requests provide a record of decisions and, with an appropriate assessment process, ensures that their change&#xD;
    impacts are considered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some important types of change requests include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Enhancement Requests&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Used by various stakeholders to request future features that they desire to have included in the product. These are a&#xD;
    type of stakeholder request that capture and articulate an understanding of the stakeholders needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Defects&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reports of anomalies or failures in a delivered work product. Defects include such things as omissions and&#xD;
    imperfections found during early lifecycle phases, or symptoms of faults (failures) that need to be isolated and&#xD;
    corrected within the software. Defects may also include deviations from what can reasonably be expected of the software&#xD;
    behavior (such as usability issues).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of a defect is to communicate the details of the issue, enabling corrective action, resolution, and&#xD;
    tracking to occur.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are &lt;em>very&lt;/em> expensive to perform but, when performed well,&amp;nbsp;are highly valuable. It is crucial that&#xD;
    they be performed effectively. Identified issues should be solved outside of the meeting. Subsequent reviews need only&#xD;
    go over the action lists from the meeting to ensure each issue has been appropriately addressed. This means that action&#xD;
    lists are essential artifacts for effective reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is crucial to understand that reviews are not a replacement for good modeling in the first place. One of the basic&#xD;
    requirements prior to a review is that the model &lt;em>executes properly&lt;/em>. In a PIM review, this means that it is&#xD;
    debugged and can replicate (via execution) the use case scenarios. In a PSM review, this means that the model has&#xD;
    passed formal unit testing. You should NEVER find a compilation problem in a review; it is far cheaper to have the&#xD;
    product owner find that on their own &lt;em>prior to planning the review&lt;/em> rather than find it in a room full of&#xD;
    people. The intent of the review should be to evaluate an set of already high-quality artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is also very important to &lt;em>stay focused&lt;/em> during the review. The meeting leader needs to rule with a (silk&#xD;
    covered) iron fist. Reviews are very expensive so the object is to perform the intent of the review as efficiently as&#xD;
    possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: subsequent reviews of an already-reviewed work product should focus exclusively on the action list from the&#xD;
    previous review.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    There are a number of work products created in a modern software-centric development project. Any of them may be&#xD;
