    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>All the relevant hazards of the system and the faults that can lead to those hazards must be identified in the hazard&#xD;
analysis.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The hazard analysis is a key document for safety critical systems (see Term Definition: Safe) as it combines the&#xD;
    description of the hazards, the level of risk, system faults that can lead to the hazard, and the control measures all&#xD;
    together in a single view. The Fault is a non-compliance of the system that can lead to the identified hazard. The&#xD;
    severity is a measure of how bad the hazard is (an arbitrary scale of 1-10 is used often used). The Risk is a value&#xD;
    computed by the likelihood multiplied by the severity of the occurrence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All safety critical systems are real-time systems as well, since each fault has a period of time that it can be&#xD;
    tolerated (called its Fault Tolerance Time). To be considered safe against a specific fault, the sum of the fault&#xD;
    detection time and the control time (the time required for the control measure to handle the fault) must be less than&#xD;
    or equal to the fault tolerance time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The hazard analysis is usually coupled with one or more Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to show how faults and other&#xD;
    conditions can combine to lead to hazards.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The hazard analysis is created during the requirements analysis phase but not all aspects (such as the control&#xD;
    measures) may be identified early on. The hazard analysis should be maintained throughout the development cycle - as&#xD;
    new hazards or faults are identified, they must be added to the table. As control measures are specified, the analysis&#xD;
    must be updated as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An FMEA is most often used in a bottom-up approach - that is detailed failures are examined to determine their ultimate&#xD;
    consequences. In contrast, Fault Tree Analysis is more commonly used in a top-down approach, beginning with hazards and&#xD;
    then determining what faults elicit them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    FMEA and FTA are used in both reliability engineering and safety-critical system engineering.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An FTA uses logical operators (commonly AND, OR, and NOT, but may also include XOR, NOR, and NAND) to depict the&#xD;
    explicit relation between normal and exception (i.e. error) conditions and normal and exception (i.e. failure) events.&#xD;
    FTA can be used to depict the causal chain of events and conditions for an existing design and also drive the&#xD;
    development of design approaches (called control measures) that address the safety issues. These control measures are&#xD;
    then added to the FTA as &quot;ANDing redundancy&quot; so that for the hazard to be manifest, both the original condition or&#xD;
    fault must occur AND the control measure must fail as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An FTA is most often used in a top-down fashion, beginning with the hazards and the discovering that underlying faults&#xD;
    that can lead to them. In contrast, an Fault Means and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is most often used in a bottom up&#xD;
    fashion, beginning with the failures and then determining the consequences. Both are used in reliability and safety&#xD;
    engineering.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are&#xD;
    assigned to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to&#xD;
    develop what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or even to develop things in parallel)&#xD;
    on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interactions&#xD;
    and trust between team members, incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make&#xD;
    decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager helps the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the&#xD;
    progress and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind, the project manager helps the team assess&#xD;
    how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that&#xD;
    affect them, so that their objectives for the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout&#xD;
    the iteration.&#xD;
