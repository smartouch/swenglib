    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main objective of this task is to ensure that the stakeholder requirements are expressed in a formal, structured,&#xD;
    verifiable, unambiguous manner (this is the Engineering part of the process), to increase the chance that the system to&#xD;
    be developed is exactly the system the stakeholders need. Thus the requirements must reflect the stakeholders' needs at&#xD;
    all times during development. In some cases, there is an existing stakeholder requirements specification (which must&#xD;
    then be an input to the task) and this task is capturing new stakeholder requirements. This is a definition of the&#xD;
    problem to be solved and its context, but at a more detailed level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The refinement step is perhaps the most important as it is here that the set of stakeholder requests (and other change&#xD;
    requests) are combined with existing stakeholder requirements and turned into a consistent stakeholder requirements&#xD;
    specification. The task steps below identify the principal outputs from each step, but note that, in general, each step&#xD;
    could cause changes to any of the outputs.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, there&amp;nbsp;may be several levels of Stakeholder Requirements Specification - for example, in some cases&#xD;
    the Vision could be sufficient. In other cases, organizations may need to work with several levels of Stakeholder,&#xD;
    evolving the specification for the different levels. Typically, this&amp;nbsp;would include specifications such as&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;Product Vision, Product Objectives, Product Specification, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If more than one level of Stakeholder Requirement Specification is used, then remember the following points:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each document must be a complete and consistent description of the problem, at an appropriate level of abstraction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Traceability must be maintained throughout the levels&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All documents must be maintained in parallel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Frequently, it&amp;nbsp;is sufficient to evolve a single document. However, we recommend retaining at least the distinction&#xD;
    between the overall Vision and the Stakeholder Requirements.&#xD;

    Elements of this diagram are instances of SysML blocks that represent the use case and its associated actor(s).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Use-Case Block is the structural representation of a use case defined in the use-case diagram. It is used to&#xD;
    represent the formal specification of the system behavior for the use case and acts as a location for the&#xD;
    operations/functions that the use case employs. The Use-Case Block communicates with relevant Actor Blocks via&#xD;
    ports&amp;nbsp;and associated provided and required interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Actor Block is the realization of an actor that was previously identified in a system&amp;nbsp;use case diagram. An&#xD;
    actor block represents a person, or system that is external to the system under development, that interacts&#xD;
    with&amp;nbsp;the system under development&amp;nbsp;by providing the inputs to, and receiving&amp;nbsp;outputs&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    system under development.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Statechart Diagram describes the state-based behavior of a block. It aggregates the information from both the&#xD;
    activity diagram (functional flow) and the sequence diagrams (interactions with the environment), and adds the&#xD;
    event-driven block behavior to the diagram. As the &quot;language&quot; of statecharts is formally defined, the correctness and&#xD;
    completeness of the resulting behavior can be verified/validated through model execution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statechart diagrams are finite state machines that are extended by the notation of Hierarchy and Concurrency.&#xD;
    Basically, a statechart diagram is comprised of a set of states joined by transitions and various connectors. An event&#xD;
    may trigger a transition from one state to another. Actions can be performed on transitions and on state entry/exit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Use-Case&amp;nbsp;Block Statechart Diagram must reflect the functional flow captured in the use-case black-box activity&#xD;
    diagram as well as the associated use-case black-box sequence diagrams.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Activity Diagram is similar to the classic flow chart. It describes a workflow, business process, or algorithm by&#xD;
    decomposing the flow of execution into a set of actions and sub activities joined by transitions and various&#xD;
    connectors. These actions and sub activities are called activity nodes. An activity can be a simple linear sequence of&#xD;
    activity nodes or it can be a complex series of parallel activity nodes with conditional branching and concurrency.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will be multiple instances of this artifact.&amp;nbsp;During requirements analysis, &quot;black-box&quot; activity diagrams are&#xD;
    created describing the functional flows for the system as a whole.&amp;nbsp;During architectural design,&#xD;
    &quot;white-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;activity diagrams are created that show the allocation of actions to specific system elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities may be grouped and assigned to objects - e.g. subsystems. In this case, the activity diagram is split into&#xD;
    swim lanes that depict the respective responsibilities.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes the time-ordered sequence of interactions between a system use case and its associated actors.&#xD;
    In addition to the sent and received messages (service requests), the use-case lifeline shows the requested operations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will be multiple instances of this artifact.&amp;nbsp;Initially, &quot;black-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;sequence diagrams are created which&#xD;
    evolve into &quot;white-box&quot;&amp;nbsp;sequence diagrams that show the&amp;nbsp;responsibilities of&amp;nbsp;specific system elements.&#xD;
