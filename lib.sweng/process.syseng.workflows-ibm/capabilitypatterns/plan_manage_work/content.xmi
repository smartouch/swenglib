    Work Items should contain estimates. See guidelines on managing work items and agile estimation.&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes and enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). When work items are&#xD;
    assigned to an iteration, no matter what their previous priorities, the team has to make sure that they are able to&#xD;
    develop what has been assigned to the iteration. Deciding what to develop first (or even to develop things in parallel)&#xD;
    on an iteration will be different for each project and for each iteration within a project.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references those&#xD;
    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;
    results and actions from assessments.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    During project planning, iterations are identified, but the estimates have an acceptable uncertainty due to the lack of&#xD;
    detail at the project inception. This task is repeated for each iteration within a release. It allows the team to&#xD;
    increase the accuracy of the estimates for one iteration, as more detail is known along the project. The project&#xD;
    manager has the responsibility of ensuring that the team commits to a reasonable amount of work for the iteration,&#xD;
    based on team performance from previous iterations.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This list should capture the critical and serious risks. If you find this list extending beyond 20 items, carefully&#xD;
    consider whether they are really serious risks. Tracking more than 20 risks is an onerous task.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This list identifies, in decreasing order of priority, all the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select an approach for the collection of basic metrics: ideally, they are automatically generated from the tools at&#xD;
    hand, but can be manually assembled, or both. Outline which metrics the project should use in the &lt;a&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interactions&#xD;
    and trust between team members, incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make&#xD;
    decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager helps the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the&#xD;
    progress and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind, the project manager helps the team assess&#xD;
    how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that&#xD;
    affect them, so that their objectives for the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout&#xD;
    the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Coordinate the assessment and discuss with the team how the iteration results will be best presented to stakeholders, so&#xD;
that they can learn as much about the solution as possible. Listen to what the team has to say about what went wrong (and&#xD;
what went right) during the iteration. This knowledge will help everybody make informed decisions about the next iteration&#xD;
planning, and determine the best course of action for the project. This task is performed at the end of every iteration&#xD;
until the end of the project.</refinedDescription>
